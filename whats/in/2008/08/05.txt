What's in git.git (Aug 2008, #05; Wed, 20)

  maint 9b99e64 (Update draft release notes for 1.6.0.1)
 master ea3594e (Update draft release notes for 1.6.1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have to say I've been very productive since 1.6.0 relase and it is _not_
a good thing.  Many minor bugs are discovered by the list regulars, but
they really  should have been found and fixed during the -rc period.
Let's try to do better in this cycle.

Anyway, thanks everybody for finding and fixing bugs and supplying bugfix
patches with test cases.  Perhaps we would need a 1.6.0.1 this weekend.

* The 'maint' branch has these fixes since the last announcement.

Jeff King (2):
  mailinfo: avoid violating strbuf assertion
  decorate: allow const objects to be decorated

  git format-patch: avoid underrun when format.headers is empty or all NLs
  remote.c: remove useless if-before-free test

Junio C Hamano (5):
  diff --check: do not get confused by new blank lines in the middle
