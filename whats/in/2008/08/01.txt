What's in git.git (Aug 2008, #01; Tue, 05)

  maint 2d0f5f3 (RelNotes 1.5.6.5 updates, 2008-08-05)
 master ddd63e6 (Optimize sha1_object_info for loose objects, not concurrent repacks, 2008-08-05)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks to many people, we have accumulated quite a few fixes that are
appropriate for 1.6.0 stabilization effort but at the same time apply
equally well to 1.5.6 series.  We might want to do 1.5.6.5 to flush them
while we are at it.

I am planning to tag 1.6.0-rc2 tomorrow evening.  I noticed that both gitk
and git-gui have fixes and many updated translations that I intend to
pull before tagging -rc2.

* The 'maint' branch has these fixes since the last announcement.
