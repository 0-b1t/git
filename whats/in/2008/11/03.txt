What's in git.git (Nov 2008, #03; Sat, 15)

  maint 9e77353 (Documentation: git-svn: fix example for centralized SVN clone)
 master ea4f2bd (Merge branch 'maint')
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider that the tip of 'master' is 1.6.1-rc0, although I haven't tagged
it as such.  There are a handful more topics cooking in 'next' and they
are worthy of being in 1.6.1 final.


* The 'maint' branch has these fixes since the last announcement.
