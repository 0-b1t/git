What's in git.git (Feb 2010, #01; Mon, 08)

  maint e33cc59 (Merge branch 'maint-1.6.5' into maint)
 master 8b2337a (t3902: Protect against OS X normalization)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not much is going on in 'next' and 'pu'.

* The 'master' branch has these since v1.7.0-rc2 in addition to what are
  in 'maint'.

* The 'maint' branch has these fixes since v1.6.6.1; they are mostly minor
