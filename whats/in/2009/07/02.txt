What's in git.git (Jul 2009, #02; Wed, 29)

  maint 0a53e9d (GIT 1.6.4)
 master e658002 (Translate the tutorial to Brazillian Portuguese)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I took advices from the list and merged tests that have been parked in
'pu' during the 1.6.4 cycle to 'master'.  Even though I did not see much
feedback to the pt_BR translation of the tutorial, I decided to merge it
as well, since I do not read/speak the language.

We have reasonably solid topics that have been cooking in 'next' for quite
some time.  Hopefully the 1.6.5 cycle will be short and smooth.

* The 'master' branch has these since the last announcement.

Alex Riesen (1):
  Add a reminder test case for a merge with F/D transition

Heiko Voigt (2):
  cvsimport: add test illustrating a bug in cvsps
  cvsimport: extend testcase about patchset order to contain branches

Junio C Hamano (3):
  t/t9600: remove exit after test_done
  Start 1.6.5 cycle
  request-pull: optionally show a patch as well

Michael Haggerty (5):
  Start a library for cvsimport-related tests
  Use CVS's -f option if available (ignore user's ~/.cvsrc file)
  Test contents of entire cvsimported "master" tree contents
  Add some tests of git-cvsimport's handling of vendor branches
  Add a test of "git cvsimport"'s handling of tags and branches

Thadeu Lima de Souza Cascardo (1):
  Translate the tutorial to Brazillian Portuguese
