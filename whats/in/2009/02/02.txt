What's in git.git (Feb 2009, #02; Wed, 11)

  maint e5887c1 (Prepare for 1.6.1.4.)
 master 30aa4fb (Merge branch 'maint')
------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are handful of fixes for 1.6.1.4 on maint that are also in master.

The 'notes' topic has been kicked out of master for now.  

I think 'master' is ready to be tagged as v1.6.2-rc1, but I'll be giving a
few days for people to try out the current 'master' before doing so.  I've
merged git-svn updates, but haven't pulled either git-gui or gitk updates
yet, which need to happen before -rc1.
