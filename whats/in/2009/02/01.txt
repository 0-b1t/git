What's in git.git (Feb 2009, #01; Sun, 01)

  maint 6ac9229 (Merge branch 'maint-1.6.0' into maint)
 master 2ea3c17 (t3412: use log|name-rev instead of log --graph)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are yet more fixes that have been cooking in next and then master
that have been merged to 'maint' in preparation for the next 1.6.1.X
maintenance release.

On the 'master' front, I think we are ready to plan for 1.6.2 release.
Tonight's "What's cooking" should be a pretty good guide for estimating
what will be in -rc0, in addition to what we already have in 'master'.
