What's in git.git (Apr 2009, #01; Thu, 09)

  maint db12d97 (Start 1.6.2.3 preparation)
 master e37347b (Update draft release notes to 1.6.3)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have quite a few documentation fixes accumulated on the maint branch
perhaps a new maintenance release 1.6.2.3 mid next week.

On the 'master' front, there are currently 6 topics cooking in 'next', all
of which look quite good.  I'll probably tag 1.6.3-rc0 this weekend with
most of these topics and keep cooking the rest for 1.6.4 cycle.

* The 'maint' branch has these fixes since the last announcement.
