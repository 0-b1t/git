What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2008, #05; Wed, 22)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed
with '-' are only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are
in 'next'.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* cj/maint-gitpm-fix-maybe-self (Sat Oct 18 20:25:12 2008 +0200) 1 commit

should be used.

A major cleanup on the way gitweb parses its input arguments.
Future gitweb patches to add more arguments into the PATH_INFO
depend upon this initial cleanup work.

 + diff: unify external diff and funcname parsing code

A general cleanup on how diff drivers are implemented.  Its still
missing documentation updates and tests but doesn't break anything
current as far as I can tell.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

 - update-index: refactor mark_valid() in preparation for new options
 - ls-files: add options to support sparse checkout
 - Introduce CE_NO_CHECKOUT bit
 - Extend index to save more flags

Needs review.

 - Allow xdiff machinery to cache hash results for a file
 - Always initialize xpparam_t to 0

RÃ©ne had good comments on how the callback should be structured.
Waiting for a reroll.

 - gitweb: Better processing format string in custom links in navbar

Waiting for some sort of response from Pasky.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Actively Cooking]

 - improve index-pack tests
 + fix multiple issues in index-pack
 + index-pack: smarter memory usage during delta resolution
 + index-pack: rationalize delta resolution code

The buglets that caused people on 'next' some surprises are quickly
killed.  Thanks.

* sh/rebase-i-p (Wed Oct 22 11:59:30 2008 -0700) 9 commits
 + git-rebase--interactive.sh: comparision with == is bashism
 + rebase-i-p: minimum fix to obvious issues
 + rebase-i-p: if todo was reordered use HEAD as the rewritten parent
 + rebase-i-p: do not include non-first-parent commits touching
   UPSTREAM
 + rebase-i-p: only list commits that require rewriting in todo
 + rebase-i-p: fix 'no squashing merges' tripping up non-merges
 + rebase-i-p: delay saving current-commit to REWRITTEN if squashing
 + rebase-i-p: use HEAD for updating the ref instead of mapping
   OLDHEAD
 + rebase-i-p: test to exclude commits from todo based on its parents

Changes the `rebase -i -p` behavior to behave like git sequencer's
rewrite of `rebase -i` would behave.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[On Hold]

* jc/post-simplify (Fri Aug 15 01:34:51 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 - revision --simplify-merges: incremental simplification
 - revision --simplify-merges: prepare for incremental simplification

I started making this incremental but the progress is not
so great.

* jc/send-pack-tell-me-more (Thu Mar 20 00:44:11 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - "git push": tellme-more protocol extension

This seems to have a deadlock during communication between the peers.
Someone needs to pick up this topic and resolve the deadlock before it can
continue.

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 - blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 - git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output

* jk/renamelimit (Sat May 3 13:58:42 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - diff: enable "too large a rename" warning when -M/-C is explicitly
   asked for

This would be the right thing to do for command line use,
but gitk will be hit due to tcl/tk's limitation, so I am holding
this back for now.
