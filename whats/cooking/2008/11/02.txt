What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2008, #02; Wed, 05)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed
with '-' are only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are
in 'next'.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

The topmost one unconditionally enables threaded delta search on any

may not be what we want.

 + autoconf: Add link tests to each AC_CHECK_FUNC() test

Attempts to help FreeBSD whose compiler does not error out when told to

[Stalled]

 - grep: skip files outside sparse checkout area
 - checkout_entry(): CE_NO_CHECKOUT on checked out entries.
 - Prevent diff machinery from examining worktree outside sparse
   checkout

 - update-index: add --checkout/--no-checkout to update
   CE_NO_CHECKOUT bit
 - update-index: refactor mark_valid() in preparation for new options
 - ls-files: add options to support sparse checkout

Waiting for some sort of response from Pasky.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[On Hold]

* jc/send-pack-tell-me-more (Thu Mar 20 00:44:11 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - "git push": tellme-more protocol extension

This seems to have a deadlock during communication between the peers.
Someone needs to pick up this topic and resolve the deadlock before it can
continue.

* jk/renamelimit (Sat May 3 13:58:42 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - diff: enable "too large a rename" warning when -M/-C is explicitly
   asked for

This would be the right thing to do for command line use,
but gitk will be hit due to tcl/tk's limitation, so I am holding
this back for now.
