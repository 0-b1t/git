What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2008, #04; Wed, 12)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed
with '-' are only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are
in 'next'.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

I think we should declare -rc0 by the end of this week, with the goal of
including everything that are in 'next' as of tonight, plus the "narrow
checkout" and possibly Pierre's send-email that acts as format-patch
frontend, by the time we hit -rc1, perhaps soon after the end of month.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Early parts looked Ok; I am trying to find time to review the whole thing
but fixing bugs in topics from other people here and there took almost all
my time this weekend.  Not good.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[On Hold]

* jc/send-pack-tell-me-more (Thu Mar 20 00:44:11 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - "git push": tellme-more protocol extension

This seems to have a deadlock during communication between the peers.
Someone needs to pick up this topic and resolve the deadlock before it can
continue.

* jk/renamelimit (Sat May 3 13:58:42 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - diff: enable "too large a rename" warning when -M/-C is explicitly
   asked for

This would be the right thing to do for command line use,
but gitk will be hit due to tcl/tk's limitation, so I am holding
this back for now.
