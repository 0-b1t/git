What's cooking in git.git (Dec 2009, #06; Thu, 31)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

The tip of 'next' will soon be rebuilt on top of the current 'master'.

--------------------------------------------------

* mh/rebase-fixup (2009-12-07) 2 commits
 - Add a command "fixup" to rebase --interactive
 - t3404: Use test_commit to set up test repository
 (this branch is used by ns/rebase-auto-squash.)

Initial round of "fixup" action that is similar to "squash" action in
"rebase -i" that excludes the commit log message from follow-up commits
when composing the log message for the updated one.  Expected is a further
improvement to skip opening the editor if a pick is followed only by
"fixup" and no "squash".

 - fixup! rebase -i --autosquash
 - rebase -i --autosquash: auto-squash commits
 (this branch uses mh/rebase-fixup.)

 - Refactor notes concatenation into a flexible interface for combining notes
 - Notes API: Allow multiple concurrent notes trees with new struct notes_tree

 - Notes API: get_note(): Return the note annotating the given object
 - Notes API: add_note(): Add note objects to the internal notes tree structure
 - Notes API: init_notes(): Initialize the notes tree from the given notes ref
 - Notes API: get_commit_notes() -> format_note() + remove the commit restriction
 - Minor style fixes to notes.c
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-12-29 at c89a730)

 - Make "subtree" part more orthogonal to the rest of merge-recursive.
 - Teach git-pull to pass -X<option> to git-merge

"git pull" patch needs sq-then-eval fix to protect it from $IFS
but otherwise seemed good.

 - INSTALL: document a simpler way to run uninstalled builds
 - run test suite without dashed git-commands in PATH

[Ejected]

* il/exec-error-report (2009-12-30) 2 commits
 . Improve transport helper exec failure reporting
 . Report exec errors from run-command

Freezes "git log" or anything that uses pager; J6t made quite a many good
suggestions.  Expecting more rounds of reroll.

* je/send-email-no-subject (2009-08-05) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 1b99c56)
 + send-email: confirm on empty mail subjects

* jc/fix-tree-walk (2009-10-22) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-22 at 10c0c8f)
 + Revert failed attempt since 353c5ee
 + read-tree --debug-unpack
  (merged to 'next' on 2009-10-11 at 0b058e2)
 + unpack-trees.c: look ahead in the index
 + unpack-trees.c: prepare for looking ahead in the index
 + Aggressive three-way merge: fix D/F case
 + traverse_trees(): handle D/F conflict case sanely
 + more D/F conflict tests
 + tests: move convenience regexp to match object names to test-lib.sh

This has some stupid bugs and reverted from 'next' until I can fix it, but
the "temporarily" turned out to be very loooong.

* jc/grep-full-tree (2009-11-24) 1 commit
 . grep: --full-tree

The interaction with this option and pathspecs need to be worked out
better.  I _think_ "grep --full-tree -e pattern -- '*.h'" should find from
all the header files in the tree, for example.
