Done in 0.99.9
==============

Ports
~~~~~

* Cygwin port [HPA].

* OpenBSD build [Merlyn and others].


Fixes
~~~~~

* clone request over git native protocol from a repository with
  too many refs did not work; this has been fixed.

* git-daemon got safer for kernel.org use [HPA].

* Extended SHA1 parser was not enforcing uniqueness for
  abbreviated SHA1; this has been fixed.

* http transport does not barf on funny characters in URL.

* The ref naming restrictions have been formalized and the
  coreish refuses to create funny refs; we still need to audit
  importers.  See git-check-ref-format(1).


New Features and Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* .git/config file as a per-repository configuration mechanism,
  and some commands understand it [Linus].  See
  git(7).

* The core.filemode configuration item can be used to make us a
  bit more FAT friendly.  See git(7).

* The extended SHA1 notation acquired Peel-the-onion operator
  ^{type} and ^{}.  See git-rev-parse(1).

* SVN importer [Matthias].  See git-svnimport(1).

* .git/objects/[0-9a-f]{2} directories are created on demand,
  and removed when becomes empty after prune-packed [Linus].

* Filenames output from various commands without -z option are
  quoted when they embed funny characters (TAB and LF) using
  C-style quoting within double-quotes, to match the proposed
  GNU diff/patch notation [me, but many people contributed in
  the discussion].

* git-mv is expected to be a better replacement for git-rename.
  While the latter has two parameter restriction, it acts more
  like the regular 'mv' that can move multiple things to one
  destinatino directory [Josef Weidendorfer].

* git-checkout can take filenames to revert the changes to
  them.  See git-checkout(1)

* The new program git-am is a replacement for git-applymbox that
  has saner command line options and a bit easier to use when a
  patch does not apply cleanly.

* git-ls-remote can show unwrapped onions using ^{} notation, to
  help Cogito to track tags.

* git-merge-recursive backend can merge unrelated projects.

* git-clone over native transport leaves the result packed.

* git-http-fetch issues multiple requests in parallel when
  underlying cURL library supports it [Nick and Daniel].

* git-fetch-pack and git-upload-pack try harder to figure out
  better common commits [Johannes].

* git-read-tree -u removes a directory when it makes it empty.

* git-diff-* records abbreviated SHA1 names of original and
  resulting blob; this sometimes helps to apply otherwise an
  unapplicable patch by falling back to 3-way merge.

* git-format-patch now takes series of from..to rev ranges and
  with '-m --stdout', writes them out to the standard output.
  This can be piped to 'git-am' to implement cheaper
  cherry-picking.

* git-tag takes '-u' to specify the tag signer identity [Linus].

* git-rev-list can take optional pathspecs to skip commits that
  do not touch them (--dense) [Linus].

* Comes with new and improved gitk [Paulus and Linus].
