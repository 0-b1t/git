 * Updated behavior of existing commands.
 
+  - "git mergetool" chooses its backend more wisely, taking
+    notice of its environment such as use of X, Gnome/KDE, etc.
+
+  - "gitweb" shows merge commits a lot nicer than before.  The
+    default view uses more compact --cc format, while the UI
+    allows to choose normal diff with any parent.
+
+  - snapshot files "gitweb" creates from a repository at
+    $path/$project/.git are more useful.  We use $project part
+    in the filename, which we used to discard.
+
+  - "git cvsimort" creates lightweight tag; there is not any
+    interesting information we can record in an annotated tag,
+    and the handcrafted ones the old code created was not
+    properly formed anyway.

     branches if you have any.

 Fixes since v1.5.2
 ------------------
 
 All of the fixes in v1.5.2 maintenance series are included in
 this release, unless otherwise noted.
 
-* Bugfixes
+* Bugfixes ('+' needs cherry-picking to maint)
+
+  + "git-merge-recursive" does not try to run file level merge
+    on binary files.
+
+  + "git-branch --track" did not create tracking configuration
+    correctly when the branch name had slash in it.
+
+  + "gitweb" had trouble handling non UTF-8 text with older
+    Encode.pm Perl module.
+
+  + The email address of the user specified with user.email
+    configuration was overriden by EMAIL environment variable.
+
+  + The tree parser did not warn about tree entries with
+    nonsense file modes, and assumed they must be blobs.
 
   - ....  This has not
     been backported to 1.5.2.x series, as it is rather an
     intrusive change.
