Good point - use of environment variables is more consistent.  Use of
command-line arguments is a bit more convenient in my case since I'm
driving the transfer from a perl script, but I suppose consistency is
more important...

I am seriously looking at putting one together in the D language 
(http://www.digitalmars.com/d) <plug>, though it doesn't actually do 
anything as of yet, since I have to balance classes along with it.

I setup a git repository for gipy... Didn't upload any files in
sourceforge because I don't think is ready.

Well, I kinda work on one written in C using a libgit (using exec of git
executable for the moment) It doesn't do that much at the moment:
commiting, adding files, removing files.

At some point I'ld like to have a very integrated and easy to use
porcelain, but for now that's more a learning git by practice kind of
project.

Python integration needs either lots of fork+exec, a git rewrite in
Python, or a libgit reorganization in library-ized C.

I'm doing the latter, but my free time is kindof limited for now.

My library-ize branch is at 
	git fetch http://netz.smurf.noris.de/git/git.git libize
if anybody wants to have a look. My first goal is to get object access
working sanely (because that's what I need for my Python project).

I haven't merged up for some time, though.

I'd like to make this friendly behavior [ls-files -o not showing
contents of untracked directory] the default in my porcelain.

I am right now making a gnome based git repository browser [1].
