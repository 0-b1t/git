What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2008, issue #03; Mon, 07)
--------------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed
with '-' are only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are
in 'next'.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be applied to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their
names.

It already is beginning to become clear what 1.6.0 will look like.  Wha=
t's
already in 'next' all are well intentioned (I do not guarantee they are
already bug-free --- that is what cooking them in 'next' is for) and ar=
e
good set of feature enhancements.  Bigger changes will be:

 * Port for MinGW.

 * With the default Makefile settings, most of the programs will be
   installed outside your $PATH, except for "git", "gitk", "git-gui" an=
d
   some server side programs that need to be accessible for technical
   reasons.  Invoking a git subcommand as "git-xyzzy" from the command
   line has been deprecated since early 2006 (and officially announced =
in
   1.5.4 release notes); use of them from your scripts after adding
   output from "git --exec-path" to the $PATH will still be supported i=
n
   1.6.0, but users are again strongly encouraged to adjust their
   scripts to use "git xyzzy" form, as we will stop installing
   "git-xyzzy" hardlinks for built-in commands in later releases.

 * git-merge will be rewritten in C.

 * default pack and idx versions will be updated as scheduled for some
   time ago.

 * GIT_CONFIG, which was only documented as affecting "git config", but
   actually affected all git commands, now only affects "git config".
   GIT_LOCAL_CONFIG, also only documented as affecting "git config" and
   not different from GIT_CONFIG in a useful way, is removed.

[New Topics]

* jc/rebase-orig-head (Mon Jul 7 00:16:38 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 + Teach "am" and "rebase" to mark the original position with
   ORIG_HEAD

* sb/sequencer (Tue Jul 1 04:38:34 2008 +0200) 4 commits
 . Migrate git-am to use git-sequencer
 . Add git-sequencer test suite (t3350)
 . Add git-sequencer prototype documentation
 . Add git-sequencer shell prototype

* js/pick-root (Fri Jul 4 16:19:52 2008 +0100) 1 commit
 + Allow cherry-picking root commits

* ab/bundle (Sat Jul 5 17:26:40 2008 -0400) 1 commit
 + Teach git-bundle to read revision arguments from stdin like git-
   rev-list.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Will merge to master soon]

* js/apply-root (Sun Jul 6 18:36:01 2008 -0700) 3 commits
 + git-apply --directory: make --root more similar to GNU diff
 + apply --root: thinkofix.
 + Teach "git apply" to prepend a prefix with "--root=3D<root>"

* jc/reflog-expire (Sat Jun 28 22:24:49 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 + Make default expiration period of reflog used for stash infinite
 + Per-ref reflog expiry configuration

As 1.6.0 will be a good time to make backward incompatible changes, the
tip commit makes the default expiry period of stash 'never', unless you
configure them to expire explicitly using gc.refs/stash.* variables.
Needs consensus, but I am guessing that enough people would want stash
that does not expire.

* jk/pager-config (Thu Jul 3 07:46:57 2008 -0400) 1 commit
 + Allow per-command pager config

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Actively Cooking]

* sg/stash-k-i (Fri Jun 27 16:37:15 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + stash: introduce 'stash save --keep-index' option

One weakness of our "partial commit" workflow support used to be that t=
he
user can incrementally build what is to be committed in the index but t=
hat
state cannot be tested as a whole in the working tree.  This allows you=
 to
temporarily stash the remaining changes in the working tree so that the
index state before running "stash save --keep-index" can be seen in the
working tree to be tested and then committed.

* am/stash-branch (Mon Jul 7 02:50:10 2008 +0530) 2 commits
 + Add a test for "git stash branch"
 + Implement "git stash branch <newbranch> <stash>"

Creates a new branch out of the stashed state, after returning from the
interrupt that forced you to create the stash in the first place.

* tr/add-i-e (Thu Jul 3 00:00:00 2008 +0200) 3 commits
 + git-add--interactive: manual hunk editing mode
 + git-add--interactive: remove hunk coalescing
 + git-add--interactive: replace hunk recounting with apply --recount

Adds 'e/dit' action to interactive add command.

* jc/report-tracking (Sun Jul 6 02:54:56 2008 -0700) 5 commits
 + branch -r -v: do not spit out garbage
 + stat_tracking_info(): clear object flags used during counting
 + git-branch -v: show the remote tracking statistics
 + git-status: show the remote tracking statistics
 + Refactor "tracking statistics" code used by "git checkout"

Makes the "your branch is ahead of the tracked one by N commits" logic =
and
messages available to other commands; status and branch are updated.

* jc/merge-theirs (Mon Jun 30 22:18:57 2008 -0700) 5 commits
 + Make "subtree" part more orthogonal to the rest of merge-
   recursive.
 + Teach git-pull to pass -X<option> to git-merge
 + Teach git-merge to pass -X<option> to the backend strategy module
 + git-merge-recursive-{ours,theirs}
 + git-merge-file --ours, --theirs

Punting a merge by discarding your own work in conflicting parts but st=
ill
salvaging the parts that are cleanly automerged.  It is likely that thi=
s
will result in nonsense mishmash, but somehow often people want this, s=
o
here they are.  The interface to the backends is updated so that you ca=
n
say "git merge -Xours -Xsubtree=3Dfoo/bar/baz -s recursive other" now.

The -X<option> part may change, Dscho mentions that a single-letter -X
that take stuck option is against syntax rules, and I think he's right.

This is more "because we can", not "because we need to".

* mv/merge-in-c (Mon Jul 7 19:24:20 2008 +0200) 15 commits
 - Build in merge
 + Fix t7601-merge-pull-config.sh on AIX
 + git-commit-tree: make it usable from other builtins
 + Add new test case to ensure git-merge prepends the custom merge
   message
 + Add new test case to ensure git-merge reduces octopus parents when
   possible
 + Introduce reduce_heads()
 + Introduce get_merge_bases_many()
 + Add new test to ensure git-merge handles more than 25 refs.
 + Introduce get_octopus_merge_bases() in commit.c
 + git-fmt-merge-msg: make it usable from other builtins
 + Move read_cache_unmerged() to read-cache.c
 + Add new test to ensure git-merge handles pull.twohead and
   pull.octopus
 + Move parse-options's skip_prefix() to git-compat-util.h
 + Move commit_list_count() to commit.c
 + Move split_cmdline() to alias.c

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* js/import-zip (Mon Jun 30 19:50:44 2008 +0100) 1 commit
 + Add another fast-import example, this time for .zip files

* db/no-git-config (Mon Jun 30 03:37:47 2008 -0400) 1 commit
 + Only use GIT_CONFIG in "git config", not other programs

* dr/ceiling (Mon May 19 23:49:34 2008 -0700) 4 commits
 + Eliminate an unnecessary chdir("..")
 + Add support for GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES
 + Fold test-absolute-path into test-path-utils
 + Implement normalize_absolute_path

* jc/rerere (Sun Jun 22 02:04:31 2008 -0700) 5 commits
 + rerere.autoupdate
 + t4200: fix rerere test
 + rerere: remove dubious "tail_optimization"
 + git-rerere: detect unparsable conflicts
 + rerere: rerere_created_at() and has_resolution() abstraction

A new configuration will allow paths that have been resolved cleanly by
rerere to be updated in the index automatically.

* js/maint-daemon-syslog (Thu Jul 3 16:27:24 2008 +0100) 1 commit
 + git daemon: avoid calling syslog() from a signal handler

Meant for 'maint' as well.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[On Hold]

* sg/merge-options (Sun Apr 6 03:23:47 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + merge: remove deprecated summary and diffstat options and config
   variables

This was previously in "will be in master soon" category, but it turns =
out
that the synonyms to the ones this one deletes are fairly new invention
that happend in 1.5.6 timeframe, and we cannot do this just yet.  Perha=
ps
in 1.7.0.

* jc/dashless (Thu Jun 26 16:43:34 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 + Revert "Make clients ask for "git program" over ssh and local
   transport"
 + Make clients ask for "git program" over ssh and local transport

This is the "botched" one.  Will be resurrected during 1.7.0 or 1.8.0
timeframe.

* jk/renamelimit (Sat May 3 13:58:42 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - diff: enable "too large a rename" warning when -M/-C is explicitly
   asked for

This would be the right thing to do for command line use, but gitk will=
 be
hit due to tcl/tk's limitation, so I am holding this back for now.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled/Needs more work]

* jc/grafts (Wed Jul 2 17:14:12 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - [BROKEN wrt shallow clones] Ignore graft during object transfer

Cloning or fetching from a repository from grafts did not send objects
that are hidden by grafts, but the commits in the resulting repository =
do
need these to pass fsck.  This fixes object transfer to ignore grafts.

Another fix is needed to git-prune so that it ignores grafts but treats
commits that are mentioned in grafts as reachable.

* ph/parseopt-step-blame (Tue Jun 24 11:12:12 2008 +0200) 7 commits
 - Migrate git-blame to parse-option partially.
 + parse-opt: add PARSE_OPT_KEEP_ARGV0 parser option.
 + parse-opt: fake short strings for callers to believe in.
 + parse-opt: do not print errors on unknown options, return -2
   intead.
 + parse-opt: create parse_options_step.
 + parse-opt: Export a non NORETURN usage dumper.
 + parse-opt: have parse_options_{start,end}.

I recall Pierre said something about cleaning up the last one when he
finds time, but other than that vague recollection, I lost track of thi=
s
series.  I am tempted to fork a few topics off of the pen=C3=BAltimo on=
e to
convert a few more commands as examples and merge the result to 'next'.

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 7 commits
 - blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 - git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output
 + git-blame --reverse
 + builtin-blame.c: allow more than 16 parents
 + builtin-blame.c: move prepare_final() into a separate function.
 + rev-list --children
 + revision traversal: --children option

The blame that finds where each line in the original lines moved to.  T=
his
may help a GSoC project that wants to gather statistical overview of th=
e
history.  The final presentation may need tweaking (see the log message=
 of
the commit ""git-blame --reverse" on the series).

The tip two commits are for peeling to see what's behind the blamed
commit, which we should be able to separate out into an independent top=
ic
from the rest.
