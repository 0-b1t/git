What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2010, #01; Wed, 03)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

We are passed 1.7.0-rc1; please test "master" branch to avoid giving
regressions to end users.  Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* bw/no-python-autoconf (2010-01-31) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-01 at 7c70402)
 + configure: Allow --without-python
 + configure: Allow GIT_ARG_SET_PATH to handle --without-PROGRAM

* ms/filter-branch-submodule (2010-01-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-01-28 at 226cbf8)
 + filter-branch: Add tests for submodules in tree-filter
 + filter-branch: Fix to allow replacing submodules with another content

* sp/maint-fast-import-large-blob (2010-02-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-01 at 04d206f)
 + fast-import: Stream very large blobs directly to pack
 (this branch is used by sp/fast-import-large-blob.)

Importing a large blob via fast-import may bust the pack size limit (or
2GB filesize limit found on some filesystems).

* sp/fast-import-large-blob (2010-02-01) 0 commits
 (this branch uses sp/maint-fast-import-large-blob.)

And this is to help merging the topic to newer codebase.

* jc/typo (2010-02-03) 1 commit
 - Typofixes outside documentation area

[Cooking]

* jn/maint-makedepend (2010-01-26) 5 commits
 - Makefile: drop dependency on $(wildcard */*.h)
 - Makefile: clean up http-walker.o dependency rules
 - Makefile: remove wt-status.h from LIB_H
 - Makefile: make sure test helpers are rebuilt when headers change
 - Makefile: add missing header file dependencies
 (this branch is used by jn/makedepend and jn/master-makedepend.)

These look sensible clean-up that could go to maint later.

* jn/master-makedepend (2010-01-26) 0 commits
 (this branch uses jn/maint-makedepend; is used by jn/makedepend.)

This is to help merging the clean-up to "master".

* jn/makedepend (2010-01-31) 9 commits
 - Makefile: always remove .depend directories on 'make clean'
 - Makefile: tuck away generated makefile fragments in .depend
 - Teach Makefile to check header dependencies
 - Makefile: list standalone program object files in PROGRAM_OBJS
 - Makefile: lazily compute header dependencies
 - Makefile: list generated object files in OBJECTS
 - Makefile: disable default implicit rules
 - Makefile: rearrange dependency rules
 - Makefile: transport.o depends on branch.h now
 (this branch uses jn/maint-makedepend and jn/master-makedepend.)

And this is to build on top.  I don't want to touch build infrastructure
during the pre-release freeze too much to avoid the last minute hassles
that is only discovered when I try to cut RPMs; hence this will stay out
of 'master' until 1.7.0 ships.

* jc/checkout-detached (2010-01-29) 1 commit
 - Reword "detached HEAD" notification

* jc/maint-fix-test-perm (2010-01-30) 2 commits

 - t6000lib: Fix permission

* jh/gitweb-caching (2010-01-30) 1 commit
 - gitweb: Add an option to force version match

* jn/makefile-script-lib (2010-01-31) 1 commit
 - Do not install shell libraries executable

* mv/request-pull-modernize (2010-01-29) 1 commit
 - request-pull: avoid mentioning that the start point is a single commit

* cc/reset-keep (2010-01-19) 5 commits
 - reset: disallow using --keep when there are unmerged entries
 - reset: disallow "reset --keep" outside a work tree
 - Documentation: reset: describe new "--keep" option
 - reset: add test cases for "--keep" option
 - reset: add option "--keep" to "git reset"

I do not think I'd ever use this, and I am not convinced I can sell this
to users as a great new feature without confusing them unnecessarily, but
perhaps queuing it to pu to give it wider visibility may help somebody
coming up with a better way to defend the feature and introduce it to
users without confusing them than Christan nor I managed to.
