What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2010, #03; Fri, 16)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

I've ended up merging a few more fixes to 'master'; please give it a good
final round of testing so that we can have the real thing mid next week.

Thanks.

that replaces it.

moving forward.
