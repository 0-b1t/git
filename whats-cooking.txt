What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2012, #07; Mon, 20)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' (proposed updates) while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

The first maintenance release v1.7.9.1 ironed out usability kinks in the
new features added in v1.7.9 release.  Topics that add new features and
fixes that have been cooking in 'next' start to graduate to 'master'
again.

You can find the changes described here in the integration branches of the
repositories listed at

    http://git-blame.blogspot.com/p/git-public-repositories.html

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* cb/maint-rev-list-verify-object (2012-02-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-16 at a407b9a)
 + git rev-list: fix invalid typecast

Fixes an obscure bug in "rev-list --verify" that skipped verification
depending on the phase of the moon, which dates back to 1.7.8.x series.

* cb/maint-t5541-make-server-port-portable (2012-02-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-16 at 762eefb)
 + t5541: check error message against the real port number used

Test fix.

* cb/receive-pack-keep-errors (2012-02-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-16 at 9ff846e)
 + do not override receive-pack errors

Sometimes error status detected by a check in an earlier phase of
receive-pack (the other end of 'git push') was lost by later checks,
resulting in false indication of success.

* cb/transfer-no-progress (2012-02-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-16 at ff17092)
 + push/fetch/clone --no-progress suppresses progress output

The transport programs ignored --no-progress and showed progress when
sending their output to a terminal.

* jc/diff-stat-scaler (2012-02-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-16 at 404d336)
 + diff --stat: show bars of same length for paths with same amount of changes

The output from "git diff --stat" for two paths that have the same amount
of changes showed graph bars of different length due to the way we handled
rounding errors.

* tg/tag-points-at (2012-02-13) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-13 at a8f4046)
 + builtin/tag.c: Fix a sparse warning
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-10 at 4bff88f)
 + tag: add --points-at list option

* zj/decimal-width (2012-02-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-16 at 72805c4)
 + make lineno_width() from blame reusable for others
 (this branch is used by zj/diff-stat-dyncol.)

Refactoring.

* zj/term-columns (2012-02-13) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-16 at fe70c88)
 + pager: find out the terminal width before spawning the pager
 (this branch is used by zj/diff-stat-dyncol.)

Fixes "git -p cmd" for any subcommand that cares about the true terminal
width.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* fc/push-prune (2012-02-17) 2 commits
 - remote: reorganize check_pattern_match()
 - remote: use a local variable in match_push_refs()

The first two of the three-patch RFC series.  The second one and the third
one (not queued) both need better explanation, and the third one also had
a handful of minor yuck factors all of which should be straightforward to
improve.

Expecting a reroll.

* jc/add-refresh-unmerged (2012-02-17) 1 commit
 - refresh_index: do not show unmerged path that is outside pathspec

"git add --refresh <pathspec>" warned about unmerged paths outside the
given pathspec.

* jc/diff-ignore-case (2012-02-19) 6 commits
 - diff -i
 - diff: --ignore-case
 - xdiff: introduce XDF_IGNORE_CASE
 - xdiff: introduce XDF_INEXACT_MATCH
 - xdiff: PATIENCE/HISTOGRAM are not independent option bits
 - xdiff: remove XDL_PATCH_* macros

"git diff" learned "--ignore-case" option.

* jn/gitweb-hilite-regions (2012-02-19) 5 commits
 - gitweb: Use esc_html_match_hl() in 'grep' search
 - gitweb: Highlight matched part of shortened project description
 - gitweb: Highlight matched part of project description when searching projects
 - gitweb: Highlight matched part of project name when searching projects
 - gitweb: Introduce esc_html_hl_regions
 (this branch uses jn/gitweb-search-optim.)

Not reviewed and do not know what this is about yet ;-).

* jn/gitweb-search-optim (2012-02-19) 3 commits
 - gitweb: Faster project search
 - gitweb: Option for filling only specified info in fill_project_list_info
 - gitweb: Refactor checking if part of project info need filling
 (this branch is used by jn/gitweb-hilite-regions.)

The API introduced in the second step still has yucky design, but at least
it is more clear than the previous rounds what this is trying to do.

* js/configure-libintl (2012-02-20) 1 commit
 - configure: don't use -lintl when there is no gettext support

Build fix for autoconf, meant for 'maint' track.

* pj/remote-set-branches-usage-fix (2012-02-19) 1 commit
 - remote: fix set-branches usage and documentation

Documentation fix.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jl/maint-submodule-relative (2012-02-09) 2 commits
 - submodules: always use a relative path from gitdir to work tree
 - submodules: always use a relative path to gitdir

The second one looked iffy.

* hv/submodule-recurse-push (2012-02-13) 3 commits
 - push: teach --recurse-submodules the on-demand option
 - Refactor submodule push check to use string list instead of integer
 - Teach revision walking machinery to walk multiple times sequencially

The bottom one was not clearly explained and needs a reroll.

* zj/diff-stat-dyncol (2012-02-15) 6 commits
 . diff --stat: use less columns for change counts
 - (squash to the previous -- replace the last line of the log with the following)
 - diff --stat: use the full terminal width
 - (squash to the previous -- replace the log message with this)
 - diff --stat: tests for long filenames and big change counts
 - Merge branches zj/decimal-width and zj/term-columns

I am beginning to think that the last one should wait until the dust from
the earlier part settles.

* jc/advise-push-default (2011-12-18) 1 commit
 - push: hint to use push.default=upstream when appropriate

Peff had a good suggestion outlining an updated code structure so that
somebody new can try to dip his or her toes in the development. Any
takers?

* ss/git-svn-prompt-sans-terminal (2012-01-04) 3 commits
 - fixup! 15eaaf4
 - git-svn, perl/Git.pm: extend Git::prompt helper for querying users
 - perl/Git.pm: "prompt" helper to honor GIT_ASKPASS and SSH_ASKPASS

The bottom one has been replaced with a rewrite based on comments from
Ã†var. The second one needs more work, both in perl/Git.pm and prompt.c, to
give precedence to tty over SSH_ASKPASS when terminal is available.

* jc/split-blob (2012-01-24) 6 commits
 - chunked-object: streaming checkout
 - chunked-object: fallback checkout codepaths
 - bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding
 - bulk-checkin: allow the same data to be multiply hashed
 - new representation types in the packstream
 - varint-in-pack: refactor varint encoding/decoding

Not ready.

I finished the streaming checkout codepath, but as explained in 127b177
(bulk-checkin: support chunked-object encoding, 2011-11-30), these are
still early steps of a long and painful journey. At least pack-objects and
fsck need to learn the new encoding for the series to be usable locally,
and then index-pack/unpack-objects needs to learn it to be used remotely.

Given that I heard a lot of noise that people want large files, and that I
was asked by somebody at GitTogether'11 privately for an advice on how to
pay developers (not me) to help adding necessary support, I am somewhat
dissapointed that the original patch series that was sent almost two
months ago still remains here without much comments and updates from the
developer community. I even made the interface to the logic that decides
where to split chunks easily replaceable, and I deliberately made the
logic in the original patch extremely stupid to entice others, especially
the "bup" fanboys, to come up with a better logic, thinking that giving
people an easy target to shoot for, they may be encouraged to help
out. The plan is not working :-(.

* nd/columns (2012-02-08) 15 commits
 . column: Fix some compiler and sparse warnings
 . column: add a corner-case test to t3200
 . columns: minimum coding style fixes
 . tag: add --column
 . column: support piping stdout to external git-column process
 . status: add --column
 . branch: add --column
 . help: reuse print_columns() for help -a
 . column: add column.ui for default column output settings
 . column: support columns with different widths
 . column: add columnar layout
 . Stop starting pager recursively
 . Add git-column and column mode parsing
 . column: add API to print items in columns
 . Save terminal width before setting up pager

Expecting a reroll on top of zj/term-columns topic.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* jk/diff-highlight (2012-02-13) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-20 at ba040ae)
 + diff-highlight: document some non-optimal cases
 + diff-highlight: match multi-line hunks
 + diff-highlight: refactor to prepare for multi-line hunks
 + diff-highlight: don't highlight whole lines
 + diff-highlight: make perl strict and warnings fatal

Updates diff-highlight (in contrib/).

* jn/gitweb-unborn-head (2012-02-17) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-20 at 80e3ff2)
 + gitweb: Fix "heads" view when there is no current branch

"gitweb" compared non-existent value of HEAD with the names of commit
objects at tips of branches, triggering runtime warnings.

* tr/perftest (2012-02-17) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-20 at 4c75ba9)
 + Add a performance test for git-grep
 + Introduce a performance testing framework
 + Move the user-facing test library to test-lib-functions.sh

* jb/required-filter (2012-02-17) 1 commit
 . Add a setting to require a filter to be successful

A content filter used to be a way to make the recorded contents "more
useful", but this defines a way to optionally mark a filter "required".

A few test in t0021 use 'false' as the filter, which can exit without
reading any byte from us, before we start writing and causes us to die
with SIGPIPE, leading to intermittent test failure.  I think treating this
as a failure of running the filter (the end user's filter should read what
is fed in full, produce its output and write the result back to us) is the
right thing to do, so this patch needs update the surrounding code to
handle such a situation better, probably by using sigchain_push(SIGPIPE)
or something.

* jk/config-include (2012-02-17) 10 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-20 at 7b150b7)
 + config: add include directive
 + config: eliminate config_exclusive_filename
 + config: stop using config_exclusive_filename
 + config: provide a version of git_config with more options
 + config: teach git_config_rename_section a file argument
 + config: teach git_config_set_multivar_in_file a default path
 + config: copy the return value of prefix_filename
 + t1300: add missing &&-chaining
 + docs/api-config: minor clarifications
 + docs: add a basic description of the config API

An assignment to the include.path pseudo-variable causes the named file
to be included in-place when Git looks up configuration variables.

Reverted the earlier round from 'next' and then fixed up further.

* ld/git-p4-expanded-keywords (2012-02-14) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2012-02-16 at a9004c5)
 + git-p4: add initial support for RCS keywords

Teach git-p4 to unexpand $RCS$-like keywords that are embedded in
tracked contents in order to reduce unnecessary merge conflicts.

Is this ready for 'master'?
