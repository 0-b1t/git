What's cooking in git.git (Oct 2008, #04; Sat, 18)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed
with '-' are only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are
in 'next'.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

[Dropped]

Was waiting for a reroll.

* kb/am-directory (Fri Aug 29 15:27:50 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 . git-am: Pass the --directory option through to git-apply

I think this is still buggy and drops the option when am stops with
conflicts.

RÃ©ne had good comments on how the callback should be structured.
Waiting for a reroll.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Will be merged to 'master' soon]

 + pull: allow "git pull origin $something:$current_branch" into an
   unborn branch

This adds --no-verify to git rebase, to avoid the pre-rebase hook.

* mv/merge-noff (Fri Oct 3 14:04:47 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + builtin-commit: use reduce_heads() only when appropriate

Fixes "git merge --no-ff --no-commit".

Fixes pack file renames on Windows.

* sp/describe-lwtag (Mon Oct 13 07:39:46 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 + describe: Make --tags and --all match lightweight tags more often

When the user gives --tags, the request is asking to treat lightweight and
annotated tags at equal weight, and if lightweight ones are closer, they
should be used.

* gb/formatpatch-autonbr (Thu Oct 2 16:55:39 2008 -0400) 1 commit
 + format-patch: autonumber by default

 + gitweb: refactor input parameters parse/validation

A major cleanup on the way gitweb parses its input arguments.
Future gitweb patches to add more arguments into the PATH_INFO
depend upon this initial cleanup work.

* ml/cygwin-filemode (Mon Oct 13 00:33:31 2008 -0400) 1 commit
 + compat/cygwin.c - Use cygwin's stat if core.filemode == true

* mv/clonev (Thu Oct 9 01:40:32 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + Implement git clone -v

Does what it says it does.  This may be ready for master soon,
its a pretty trivial change.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Actively Cooking]

* tr/workflow-doc (Sat Sep 13 18:11:01 2008 +0200) 2 commits
 + Documentation: Refer to git-rebase(1) to warn against rewriting
 + Documentation: new upstream rebase recovery section in git-rebase

Expecting an update.

* sh/maint-rebase3 (Sun Oct 5 23:26:52 2008 -0500) 1 commit
 + rebase--interactive: fix parent rewriting for dropped commits

* sh/rebase-i-p (Wed Oct 15 02:44:40 2008 -0500) 8 commits
 - rebase-i-p: if todo was reordered use HEAD as the rewritten parent
 - rebase-i-p: do not include non-first-parent commits touching
   UPSTREAM
 - rebase-i-p: only list commits that require rewriting in todo
 - rebase-i-p: fix 'no squashing merges' tripping up non-merges
 - rebase-i-p: delay saving current-commit to REWRITTEN if squashing
 - rebase-i-p: use HEAD for updating the ref instead of mapping
   OLDHEAD
 - rebase-i-p: test to exclude commits from todo based on its parents
 + rebase--interactive: fix parent rewriting for dropped commits

Changes the `rebase -i -p` behavior to behave like git sequencer's
rewrite of `rebase -i` would behave.

* jk/diff-convfilter (Sun Oct 5 17:43:45 2008 -0400) 4 commits
 + diff: add filter for converting binary to text
 + diff: introduce diff.<driver>.binary
 + diff: unify external diff and funcname parsing code
 + t4012: use test_cmp instead of cmp

A general cleanup on how diff drivers are implemented.  Its still
missing documentation updates and tests but doesn't break anything
current as far as I can tell.

* jn/gitweb-customlinks (Sun Oct 12 00:02:32 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 - gitweb: Better processing format string in custom links in navbar

Waiting for some sort of response from Pasky.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[On Hold]

* jc/post-simplify (Fri Aug 15 01:34:51 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 - revision --simplify-merges: incremental simplification
 - revision --simplify-merges: prepare for incremental simplification

I started making this incremental but the progress is not
so great.

* jc/send-pack-tell-me-more (Thu Mar 20 00:44:11 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - "git push": tellme-more protocol extension

This seems to have a deadlock during communication between the peers.
Someone needs to pick up this topic and resolve the deadlock before it can
continue.

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 - blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 - git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output

* jk/renamelimit (Sat May 3 13:58:42 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - diff: enable "too large a rename" warning when -M/-C is explicitly
   asked for

This would be the right thing to do for command line use,
but gitk will be hit due to tcl/tk's limitation, so I am holding
this back for now.
