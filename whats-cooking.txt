What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2010, #03; Sun, 10)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* bk/fix-relative-gitdir-file (2010-01-08) 2 commits
 - Handle relative paths in submodule .git files
 - Test update-index for a gitlink to a .git file

* jc/ident (2010-01-08) 3 commits
 - ident.c: treat $EMAIL as giving user.email identity explicitly
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-01-10 at f1f9ded)
 + ident.c: check explicit identity for name and email separately
 + ident.c: remove unused variables

* jc/ls-files-ignored-pathspec (2010-01-08) 4 commits
 - ls-files: fix overeager pathspec optimization
 - read_directory(): further split treat_path()
 - read_directory_recursive(): refactor handling of a single path into a separate function
 - t3001: test ls-files -o ignored/dir

* js/exec-error-report (2010-01-10) 4 commits
 - Improve error message when a transport helper was not found
 - start_command: detect execvp failures early
 - run-command: move wait_or_whine earlier

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* ap/merge-backend-opts (2008-07-18) 6 commits
 - Document that merge strategies can now take their own options
 - Extend merge-subtree tests to test -Xsubtree=dir.
 - Make "subtree" part more orthogonal to the rest of merge-recursive.
 - Teach git-pull to pass -X<option> to git-merge
 - git merge -X<option>
 - git-merge-file --ours, --theirs

"git pull" patch needs sq-then-eval fix to protect it from $IFS
but otherwise seemed good.

* jh/commit-status (2009-12-07) 1 commit
 - [test?] Add commit.status, --status, and --no-status

Needs tests.

* mh/rebase-fixup (2009-12-07) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-01-06 at c4779a7)
 + Add a command "fixup" to rebase --interactive
 + t3404: Use test_commit to set up test repository
 (this branch is used by ns/rebase-auto-squash.)

Expecting further improvements to skip opening the editor if a pick is
followed only by "fixup" and no "squash".

* ns/rebase-auto-squash (2009-12-08) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-01-06 at da4e2f5)
 + rebase -i --autosquash: auto-squash commits
 (this branch uses mh/rebase-fixup.)

Blocked by the above.

* jh/notes (2009-12-07) 11 commits
 - Refactor notes concatenation into a flexible interface for combining notes
 - Notes API: Allow multiple concurrent notes trees with new struct notes_tree
 - Notes API: for_each_note(): Traverse the entire notes tree with a callback
 - Notes API: get_note(): Return the note annotating the given object
 - Notes API: add_note(): Add note objects to the internal notes tree structure
 - Notes API: init_notes(): Initialize the notes tree from the given notes ref
 - Notes API: get_commit_notes() -> format_note() + remove the commit restriction
 - Minor style fixes to notes.c
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-01-02 at ae42130)
 + Add more testcases to test fast-import of notes
 + Rename t9301 to t9350, to make room for more fast-import tests
 + fast-import: Proper notes tree manipulation

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/134738

What's the status of the fourth and later patches on this topic?  Overall
it looked reasonable, if I recall correctly what I thought when I reviewed
it last time, and I am tempted to merge it to 'next' soonish.  Please
file complaints before I do so if people have objections.

Hold: JH on 2010-01-05, http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/136183
