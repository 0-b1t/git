What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2011, #04; Tue, 16)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

The kernel.org machine seems to be very busy for the past 48 hours so it
might take a while for tonight's pushout to propagate to mirrors.

There are a few 'fixup!' commits queued in topics still in 'pu', so that
authors have a choice to just say "that fix looks good, squash it in!"
instead of going through an extra round.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* di/fast-import-deltified-tree (2011-08-14) 2 commits
 - fast-import: prevent producing bad delta
 - fast-import: add a test for tree delta base corruption

* di/parse-options-split (2011-08-11) 2 commits
 - Reduce parse-options.o dependencies
 - parse-options: export opterr, optbug

* mh/attr (2011-08-14) 7 commits
 - Unroll the loop over passes
 - Change while loop into for loop
 - Determine the start of the states outside of the pass loop
 - Change parse_attr() to take a pointer to struct attr_state
 - Increment num_attr in parse_attr_line(), not parse_attr()
 - Document struct match_attr
 - Add a file comment

All looked reasonable.

* mh/iterate-refs (2011-08-14) 6 commits
 - Retain caches of submodule refs
 - Store the submodule name in struct cached_refs
 - Allocate cached_refs objects dynamically
 - Change the signature of read_packed_refs()
 - Access reference caches only through new function get_cached_refs()
 - Extract a function clear_cached_refs()

* jn/plug-empty-tree-leak (2011-08-16) 2 commits
 - merge-recursive: take advantage of hardcoded empty tree
 - revert: plug memory leak in "cherry-pick root commit" codepath

Both looked reasonable.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jc/merge-reword (2011-05-25) 2 commits
 - merge: mark the final "Merge made by..." message for l10n
 - merge: reword the final message

Probably the topmost commit should be dropped.

* nk/branch-v-abbrev (2011-07-01) 1 commit
 - branch -v: honor core.abbrev

Perhaps needs an updated commit log message?

* di/fast-import-doc (2011-07-13) 2 commits
 - doc/fast-import: document feature import-marks-if-exists
 - doc/fast-import: clarify notemodify command

Comments from fast-import folks?

* jh/receive-count-limit (2011-05-23) 10 commits
 - receive-pack: Allow server to refuse pushes with too many objects
 - pack-objects: Estimate pack size; abort early if pack size limit is exceeded
 - send-pack/receive-pack: Allow server to refuse pushing too large packs
 - pack-objects: Allow --max-pack-size to be used together with --stdout
 - send-pack/receive-pack: Allow server to refuse pushes with too many commits
 - pack-objects: Teach new option --max-commit-count, limiting #commits in pack
 - receive-pack: Prepare for addition of the new 'limit-*' family of capabilities
 - Tighten rules for matching server capabilities in server_supports()
 - send-pack: Attempt to retrieve remote status even if pack-objects fails
 - Update technical docs to reflect side-band-64k capability in receive-pack

Would need another round to separate per-pack and per-session limits.

* jm/mergetool-pathspec (2011-06-22) 2 commits
 - mergetool: Don't assume paths are unmerged
 - mergetool: Add tests for filename with whitespace

I think this is a good idea, but it probably needs a re-roll.
Cf. $gmane/176254, 176255, 166256

* jk/generation-numbers (2011-07-14) 7 commits
 - limit "contains" traversals based on commit generation
 - check commit generation cache validity against grafts
 - pretty: support %G to show the generation number of a commit
 - commit: add commit_generation function
 - add metadata-cache infrastructure
 - decorate: allow storing values instead of pointers
 - Merge branch 'jk/tag-contains-ab' (early part) into HEAD

The initial "tag --contains" de-pessimization without need for generation
numbers is already in; backburnered.

* sr/transport-helper-fix-rfc (2011-07-19) 2 commits
 - t5800: point out that deleting branches does not work
 - t5800: document inability to push new branch with old content

* po/cygwin-backslash (2011-08-05) 2 commits
 - On Cygwin support both UNIX and DOS style path-names
 - git-compat-util: add generic find_last_dir_sep that respects is_dir_sep

I think a further refactoring (no, not my suggestion) was offered?

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]
