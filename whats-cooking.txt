What's cooking in git.git (Apr 2010, #02; Sun, 04)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* js/rebase-origin-x (2010-02-05) 1 commit
 - [RFC w/o test and incomplete] rebase: add -x option to record original commit name

I retract my objection against the idea of -x; needs polishing before
moving forward.

 - grep -O: allow optional argument specifying the pager (or editor)
 - grep: Add the option '--open-files-in-pager'

Still has locking issues?

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* sg/bash-completion (2010-02-23) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-08 at bc59860)
 + bash: completion for gitk aliases
 + bash: support user-supplied completion scripts for aliases
 + bash: support user-supplied completion scripts for user's git commands
 + bash: improve aliased command recognition

Nobody seems to care about "_git_frotz" that may potentially crash with
whatever random things the end users is doing in their environment, and
renaming them to "_git_complete_frotz" to avoid that.  So let's not worry
about that.

* cw/ws-indent-with-tab (2010-04-03) 6 commits
 - whitespace: tests for git-apply --whitespace=fix with tab-in-indent
 - whitespace: add tab-in-indent support for --whitespace=fix

 - whitespace: tests for git-diff --check with tab-in-indent error class
 - whitespace: add tab-in-indent error class
 - whitespace: we cannot "catch all errors known to git" anymore

Looked sensible.

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-02 at 0358304)
 + RPM spec: include bash completion support

This is needed in 'master' by -rc1 at the latest.

* mg/notes-reflog (2010-03-29) 2 commits
 - refs.c: Write reflogs for notes just like for branch heads
 - t3301-notes: Test the creation of reflog entries

Implementation is trivially correct; I am unsure if "notes" tree wants
reflog in the first place, though.  Please convince me and I'll move it
to 'next' soon, aiming for -rc0 or -rc1 at the latest.

* rr/remote-helper-doc (2010-03-28) 2 commits
 - Documentation/remote-helpers: Fix some typos
 - Documentation/remote-helpers: Rewrite description

Although I lost track of this series with too rapid succession of
updates, intermixed with some documentation updates in the related
areas, my impression is that area experts haven't Acked them yet.

* sr/remote-helper-export (2010-03-29) 7 commits
 - remote-helpers: add tests for testgit helper
 - remote-helpers: add testgit helper
 - remote-helpers: add support for an export command
 - remote-helpers: allow requesing the path to the .git directory
 - fast-import: always create marks_file directories
 - clone: also configure url for bare clones
 - clone: pass the remote name to remote_get

May merge to 'next', but I would prefer waiting til 1.7.2 to have
this with a confidence than fast-tracking it.

* cc/revert-strategy (2010-03-31) 5 commits
 - revert: add "--strategy" option to choose merge strategy
 - merge: make function try_merge_command non static
 - merge: refactor code that calls "git merge-STRATEGY"
 - revert: refactor merge recursive code into its own function
 - revert: use strbuf to refactor the code that writes the merge message

May merge to 'next' soon, but this is more about debugging and we are not
in a great hurry.

* mr/gitweb-jsmin (2010-04-02) 6 commits
 - gitweb: update INSTALL to use shorter make target
 - gitweb: add documentation to INSTALL regarding gitweb.js
 - instaweb: add minification awareness
 - Gitweb: add autoconfigure support for minifiers
 - Gitweb: add support for minifying gitweb.css
 - Gitweb: add ignore and clean rules for minified files

Soon in 'next', to iron out leftover issues if any.

* sc/http-late-auth (2010-04-01) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-02 at c991acf)
 + Prompt for a username when an HTTP request 401s

I would prefer waiting til 1.7.2 to have this with a confidence than
fast-tracking it.

* jk/cached-textconv (2010-04-01) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-02 at a023e3c)
 + diff: avoid useless filespec population
 + diff: cache textconv output
 + textconv: refactor calls to run_textconv
 + introduce notes-cache interface
 + make commit_tree a library function
 + fix textconv leak in emit_rewrite_diff
 + fix const-correctness of write_sha1_file

I would prefer waiting til 1.7.2 to have this with a confidence than
fast-tracking it.

* da/maint-python-startup (2010-03-27) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-01 at ca6897a)
 + Makefile: Remove usage of deprecated Python "has_key" method

Hopefully will merge to 'master' by -rc0.

* jc/conflict-marker-size (2010-03-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-01 at 164b1f4)
 + diff --check: honor conflict-marker-size attribute

Hopefully will merge to 'master' by -rc0.

* ld/discovery-limit-to-fs (2010-04-04) 4 commits
 - GIT_ONE_FILESYSTEM: flip the default to stop at filesystem boundaries
 - Add support for GIT_ONE_FILESYSTEM
 - truncate cwd string before printing error message
 - config.c: remove static keyword from git_env_bool()

Linus made a good point of making this a default, and Erick Mattos
confirmed that it won't be a problem even on Windows.

The tip one is my attempt to do just that, but I have a feeling that
it is introducing a double-negation.  ONE-FILESYSTEM that defaults to
true but the user can flip it to false to trigger NOT-LIMITED-TO-ONE
semantics.  Perhaps it should be renamed to GIT_DISCOVER_REPOSITORY_XDEV
or something that defaults to false.

* sb/fmt-merge-msg (2010-03-24) 7 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-01 at 5fcbec5)
 + fmt-merge-msg: hide summary option
 + fmt-merge-msg: remove custom string_list implementation
 + string-list: add unsorted_string_list_lookup()
 + fmt-merge-msg: use pretty.c routines
 + t6200: test fmt-merge-msg more
 + t6200: modernize with test_tick
 + fmt-merge-msg: be quiet if nothing to merge

Hopefully will merge to 'master' by -rc0.

* pc/remove-warn (2010-03-26) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-04-02 at 52fc00d)
 + Remove a redundant errno test in a usage of remove_path
 + Introduce remove_or_warn function
 + Implement the rmdir_or_warn function
 + Generalise the unlink_or_warn function

I cherry-picked only obviously sensible bits.

* ef/maint-empty-commit-log (2010-03-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-28 at aa103e5)
 + rev-list: fix --pretty=oneline with empty message

Hopefully will merge to 'master' by -rc0.

* em/checkout-orphan (2010-03-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-28 at 86b6a4f)
 + git checkout: create unparented branch by --orphan

Perhaps needs a bit of documentation updates, describing the "going open
source" scenario.

* ar/config-from-command-line (2010-03-26) 2 commits
 - Use strbufs instead of open-coded string manipulation
 - Allow passing of configuration parameters in the command line

May merge to 'next', but I would prefer waiting til 1.7.2 to have
this with a confidence than fast-tracking it.

[Dropped]

* cw/test-lib-relicense (2010-02-22) 1 commit
 . test-lib.sh: Add explicit license detail, with change from GPLv2 to GPLv2+.

I am hoping Carl or Michal Sojka can take the topic to completion without
my keeping an eye on it.  Waiting for the one with full set of Acks.

* hg/convert (2010-03-29) 5 commits
 . convert: Added core.refilteronadd feature.
 . convert: Inhibit contraction of foreign $Id$ during stats.
 . convert: Use the enum constant SAFE_CRLF_FALSE.
 . convert: Keep foreign $Id$ on checkout.
 . convert: Safer handling of $Id$ contraction.

The first two looked sensible but later one looked more like showing that
it may not have been a good idea in the first place.
