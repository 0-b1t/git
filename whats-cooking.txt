What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2008, #01; Sun, 02)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed
with '-' are only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are
in 'next'.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* mv/maint-branch-m-symref (Sat Nov 1 00:25:44 2008 +0100) 5 commits
 + update-ref --no-deref -d: handle the case when the pointed ref is
   packed
 + git branch -m: forbid renaming of a symref
 + Fix git update-ref --no-deref -d.
 + rename_ref(): handle the case when the reflog of a ref does not
   exist
 + Fix git branch -m for symrefs.

* rs/blame (Sat Oct 25 15:31:36 2008 +0200) 5 commits
 - blame: use xdi_diff_hunks(), get rid of struct patch
 - add xdi_diff_hunks() for callers that only need hunk lengths
 - Allow alternate "low-level" emit function from xdl_diff
 - Always initialize xpparam_t to 0
 - blame: inline get_patch()

* ds/uintmax-config (Sun Oct 26 03:52:47 2008 -0800) 2 commits
 - Add Makefile check for FreeBSD 4.9-SECURITY
 - Build: add NO_UINTMAX_T to support ancient systems

I amended the topmost one to widen the applicability of this new feature
to all FreeBSD 4.*, not limited to 4.9-SECURITY; testing before this hits
'next' is appreciated.

* ds/autoconf (Sun Nov 2 01:04:46 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 - DONTMERGE: fixup with a convenience macro
 - autoconf: Add link tests to each AC_CHECK_FUNC() test

The topmost one is my attempt to simplify the new way of checking; the
resulting configure.ac produces the identical configure script with or
without it, so I think it is Ok, but testing before this hits 'next' is
appreciated.  If all goes well, I think the two should be squashed into
one patch.

* jk/diff-convfilter-test-fix (Fri Oct 31 01:09:13 2008 -0400) 4 commits
 + Avoid using non-portable `echo -n` in tests.
 + add userdiff textconv tests
 + document the diff driver textconv feature
 + diff: add missing static declaration

* ar/maint-mksnpath (Mon Oct 27 11:22:09 2008 +0100) 7 commits
 + Use git_pathdup instead of xstrdup(git_path(...))
 + git_pathdup: returns xstrdup-ed copy of the formatted path
 + Fix potentially dangerous use of git_path in ref.c
 + Add git_snpath: a .git path formatting routine with output buffer
 + Fix potentially dangerous uses of mkpath and git_path
 + Fix mkpath abuse in dwim_ref and dwim_log of sha1_name.c
 + Add mksnpath which allows you to specify the output buffer

* ar/mksnpath (Thu Oct 30 18:08:58 2008 -0700) 10 commits
 + Merge branch 'ar/maint-mksnpath' into ar/mksnpath
 + Use git_pathdup instead of xstrdup(git_path(...))
 + git_pathdup: returns xstrdup-ed copy of the formatted path
 + Fix potentially dangerous use of git_path in ref.c
 + Add git_snpath: a .git path formatting routine with output buffer
 + Fix potentially dangerous uses of mkpath and git_path
 + Merge branch 'ar/maint-mksnpath' into HEAD
 + Fix potentially dangerous uses of mkpath and git_path
 + Fix mkpath abuse in dwim_ref and dwim_log of sha1_name.c
 + Add mksnpath which allows you to specify the output buffer

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Will be merged to 'master' soon]

* cj/maint-gitpm-fix-maybe-self (Sat Oct 18 20:25:12 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + Git.pm: do not break inheritance

Looked Ok; will be in 'master' soon.

* gb/gitweb-pathinfo (Tue Oct 21 21:34:54 2008 +0200) 5 commits
 + gitweb: generate parent..current URLs
 + gitweb: parse parent..current syntax from PATH_INFO
 + gitweb: use_pathinfo filenames start with /
 + gitweb: generate project/action/hash URLs
 + gitweb: parse project/action/hash_base:filename PATH_INFO

Seventh iteration.

* ag/blame-encoding (Wed Oct 22 00:55:57 2008 +0400) 1 commit
 + builtin-blame: Reencode commit messages according to git-log
   rules.

Looked Ok; will be in 'master' soon.

* mv/parseopt-checkout-index (Sat Oct 18 03:17:23 2008 +0200) 1 commit
 + parse-opt: migrate builtin-checkout-index.

Looked Ok; will be in 'master' soon.

* sh/rebase-i-p (Wed Oct 22 11:59:30 2008 -0700) 9 commits
 + git-rebase--interactive.sh: comparision with == is bashism
 + rebase-i-p: minimum fix to obvious issues
 + rebase-i-p: if todo was reordered use HEAD as the rewritten parent
 + rebase-i-p: do not include non-first-parent commits touching
   UPSTREAM
 + rebase-i-p: only list commits that require rewriting in todo
 + rebase-i-p: fix 'no squashing merges' tripping up non-merges
 + rebase-i-p: delay saving current-commit to REWRITTEN if squashing
 + rebase-i-p: use HEAD for updating the ref instead of mapping
   OLDHEAD
 + rebase-i-p: test to exclude commits from todo based on its parents

Changes the `rebase -i -p` behavior to behave like git sequencer's
rewrite of `rebase -i` would behave.

* np/index-pack (Thu Oct 23 15:05:59 2008 -0400) 5 commits
 + index-pack: don't leak leaf delta result
 + improve index-pack tests
 + fix multiple issues in index-pack
 + index-pack: smarter memory usage during delta resolution
 + index-pack: rationalize delta resolution code

The buglets that caused people on 'next' some surprises are quickly
killed.  Thanks.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Dropped]

* bd/blame (Thu Aug 21 18:22:01 2008 -0500) 5 commits
 . Use xdiff caching to improve git blame performance
 . Allow xdiff machinery to cache hash results for a file
 . Always initialize xpparam_t to 0
 . Bypass textual patch generation and parsing in git blame
 . Allow alternate "low-level" emit function from xdl_diff

RÃ©ne started code restructuring, which is queued to 'pu'; this series is
dropped.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[On Hold]

* jc/send-pack-tell-me-more (Thu Mar 20 00:44:11 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - "git push": tellme-more protocol extension

This seems to have a deadlock during communication between the peers.
Someone needs to pick up this topic and resolve the deadlock before it can
continue.

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 - blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 - git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output

* jk/renamelimit (Sat May 3 13:58:42 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - diff: enable "too large a rename" warning when -M/-C is explicitly
   asked for

This would be the right thing to do for command line use,
but gitk will be hit due to tcl/tk's limitation, so I am holding
this back for now.
