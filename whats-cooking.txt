What's cooking in git.git (Jul 2010, #02; Wed, 14)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

v1.7.2-rc3 has been tagged and hopefully we can have the final release
this weekend.  I've moved some fixes from 'pu' to 'next' but I'd like to
defer them for a bit longer.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* by/log-range-diff (2010-07-12) 18 commits
 . Minimum fix to make by/log-range-diff topic at least compile
 . add test cases for '--graph' of line level log
 . line.c output the '--graph' padding before each line
 . add parent rewrite feature to line level log
 . make rewrite_parents an external function
 . some document update
 . add two test cases
 . add --always-print option
 . map/print ranges along traversing the history topologically
 . print the line log
 . map/take range to parent
 . add range clone functions
 . export three functions from diff.c
 . parse the -L options
 . refactor parse_loc
 . add the basic data structure for line level history
 . parse-options: add two helper functions

Seems to break some tests in t403X range but we are not in a hurry.

* eb/doc-log-manpage (2010-07-07) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-07-14 at d073ef2)

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-07-14 at 910a0b5)

  (merged to 'next' on 2010-06-13 at 92245ae)

 + Makefile: Use $(sharedir)/gitweb for target 'install-gitweb'

If we are going to have a configuration variable to control this, I
strongly suspect that --reuse-config should be renamed so that the
variable can be named more sanely and in line with whatever option
that replaces it.

moving forward.
