What's cooking in git.git (Nov 2008, #03; Sun, 09)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed
with '-' are only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are
in 'next'.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* jk/deny-push-to-current (Sat Nov 8 20:49:27 2008 -0500) 2 commits
 + receive-pack: detect push to current branch of non-bare repo
 + t5516: refactor oddball tests

* dl/xdiff (Fri Nov 7 21:24:33 2008 -0800) 1 commit
 + xdiff: give up scanning similar lines early

This performance fix may eventually need to be cherry-picked to 'maint'.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

 + Allow alternate "low-level" emit function from xdl_diff
 + Always initialize xpparam_t to 0
 + blame: inline get_patch()

Attempts to help FreeBSD whose compiler does not error out when told to
compile a program that calls unavailable functions.

 + gitweb: make the supported snapshot formats array global

   checkout
 - ls-files: Add tests for --sparse and friends
 - update-index: add --checkout/--no-checkout to update
   CE_NO_CHECKOUT bit
 - update-index: refactor mark_valid() in preparation for new options
 - ls-files: add options to support sparse checkout
 - Introduce CE_NO_CHECKOUT bit
 - Extend index to save more flags

Early parts looked Ok; I am trying to find time to review the whole thing
but fixing bugs in topics from other people here and there took almost all
my time this weekend.  Not good.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Dropped]

* bc/maint-keep-pack (Mon Nov 3 14:43:22 2008 -0600) 3 commits
 . pack-objects: honor '.keep' files
 . packed_git: convert pack_local flag into a bitfield and add
   pack_keep
 . t7700: demonstrate mishandling of objects in packs with a .keep
   file

It seems this is better rethought from the design level.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[On Hold]

* jc/send-pack-tell-me-more (Thu Mar 20 00:44:11 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - "git push": tellme-more protocol extension

This seems to have a deadlock during communication between the peers.
Someone needs to pick up this topic and resolve the deadlock before it can
continue.

* jk/renamelimit (Sat May 3 13:58:42 2008 -0700) 1 commit
 - diff: enable "too large a rename" warning when -M/-C is explicitly
   asked for

This would be the right thing to do for command line use,
but gitk will be hit due to tcl/tk's limitation, so I am holding
this back for now.
