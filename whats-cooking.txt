What's cooking in git.git (Aug 2009, #01; Wed, 05)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the branches, but I am still
holding onto them.

In preparation for rewinding 'next' after a major release, one topic was
reverted and kicked back to 'pu' to give it a fresh start.

After the 1.6.5 cycle, the next release will be 1.7.0, and we will push
out the planned "push safety" change.  1.7.0 would be a good time to
introduce "justifiable" changes that are not strictly backward compatible.

During 1.6.5 cycle, 'next' will hold topics meant for 1.6.5 and 1.7.0.

 + run-command.c: squelch a "use before assignment" warning
 + receive-pack: remove unnecessary run_status report

   don't

   codes

* mk/grep-max-depth (Wed Jul 22 19:52:15 2009 +0200) 1 commit

Will merge soon.

* cc/replace (Wed May 27 07:14:09 2009 +0200) 14 commits
 + t6050: check pushing something based on a replaced commit
 + Documentation: add documentation for "git replace"

Does not seem to hurt normal operation without "replace".  The basic idea
should be easier and safer to use than the graft mechanism.  I haven't
tried the replacement myself, though.

switching machinery, and a few fix-ups.

* jc/1.7.0-diff-whitespace-only-status (Sat May 23 01:15:35 2009 -0700) 2 commits
 + diff: Rename QUIET internal option to QUICK
 + diff: change semantics of "ignore whitespace" options

This changes exit code from "git diff --ignore-whitespace" and friends
when there is no actual output.  It is a backward incompatible change, but
we could argue that it is a bugfix.

* jc/1.7.0-push-safety (Mon Feb 9 00:19:46 2009 -0800) 2 commits
 + Refuse deleting the current branch via push
 + Refuse updating the current branch in a non-bare repository via
