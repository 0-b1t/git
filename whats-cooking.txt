What's cooking in git.git (Mar 2010, #07; Sun, 28)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

As it has been about 6 weeks since the previous feature release, I'd want
to start making noises about feature freeze for 1.7.1 in a few days.  I
expect that the changes still under discussion will be ready by the time
the post 1.7.1 cycle begins, and we will hopefully have a cycle for 1.7.2
that is shorter than usual to include them.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

Another thing that this fixes is not described in the log message.

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* cw/test-lib-relicense (2010-02-22) 1 commit
 . test-lib.sh: Add explicit license detail, with change from GPLv2 to GPLv2+.

Ack-collection stopped at the last three names.  I am hoping Carl can take
it from there without my keeping an eye on it.

* js/rebase-origin-x (2010-02-05) 1 commit
 - [RFC w/o test and incomplete] rebase: add -x option to record original commit name

I retract my objection against the idea of -x; needs polishing before
moving forward.

* sg/bash-completion (2010-02-23) 4 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-08 at bc59860)
 + bash: completion for gitk aliases
 + bash: support user-supplied completion scripts for aliases
 + bash: support user-supplied completion scripts for user's git commands
 + bash: improve aliased command recognition

Perhaps rename _git_frotz -> _git_complete_frotz?  I dunno.

* sd/log-decorate (2010-02-17) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-03-08 at 58a6fba)
 + log.decorate: usability fixes
 + Add `log.decorate' configuration variable.
 + git_config_maybe_bool()

Needs squelching the configuration setting when "--pretty=raw" is given,
at least, or possibly when any "--pretty" is explicitly given.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* np/malloc-threading (2010-03-24) 1 commit
 - Make xmalloc and xrealloc thread-safe

Still has locking issues?

* bw/git-completion-rpmspec (2010-03-20) 1 commit

Shipping bash-completion as part of RPM package; since Todd Zullinger who
packages git for Fedora joined the thread, I am hoping that I can defer
the direction of the final version to the discussion between Todd and Ben.

 - git checkout: create unparented branch by --orphan

Looked reasonable, except that we might want to come up with a way to
allow people with core.logallrefupdates set to false to still override it
with "-l" when switching to this new branch.  Or we may not care.  I dunno.

Soon in 'next'.
