What's cooking in git.git (May 2011, #03; Fri, 6)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.

The main part of this cycle is expected to run thru May, aiming for a
feature freeze in early June.

We are late in the week #2 of this cycle.

[New Topics]

* sr/maint-fast-import-tighten-option-parsing (2011-05-05) 1 commit
 - fast-import: fix option parser for no-arg options

Will merge to "next".

* jc/advice-about-to-lose-commit (2011-05-06) 1 commit
 - checkout: honor advice.detachedHead when reattaching to a branch

A weather-balloon.

* mg/merge-ff-config (2011-05-06) 2 commits
 - merge: introduce merge.ff configuration variable
 - Merge branch 'jc/maint-branch-mergeoptions' into mg/merge-ff-config
 (this branch uses jc/maint-branch-mergeoptions.)

--------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* kk/maint-prefix-in-config-mak (2011-05-04) 3 commits
 - config.mak.in: allow "configure --sysconfdir=/else/where"
 - Makefile: allow sysconfdir to be used from configure
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-02 at c747ba3)
 + Honor $(prefix) set in config.mak* when defining ETC_GIT* and sysconfdir

J6t is unhappy that sysconfdir is ignored in relocatable case. Although I
personally do not think that is a problem, as it has never been an issue,
let's see what others think.

* jn/gitweb-js (2011-04-28) 13 commits
 - gitweb: Make JavaScript ability to adjust timezones configurable
 - gitweb.js: Add UI for selecting common timezone to display dates
 - gitweb: JavaScript ability to adjust time based on timezone
 - gitweb: Unify the way long timestamp is displayed
 - gitweb: Refactor generating of long dates into format_timestamp_html
 - gitweb.js: Provide getElementsByClassName method (if it not exists)
 - gitweb.js: Introduce code to handle cookies from JavaScript
 - gitweb.js: Extract and improve datetime handling
 - gitweb.js: Provide default values for padding in padLeftStr and padLeft
 - gitweb.js: Update and improve comments in JavaScript files
 - gitweb: Split JavaScript for maintability, combining on build
 - Remove gitweb/gitweb.cgi and other legacy targets from main Makefile
 - git-instaweb: Simplify build dependency on gitweb

Rerolled.  Waiting for comments.

* jn/ctags-more (2011-04-29) 3 commits
 - gitweb: Optional grouping of projects by category
 - gitweb: Modularized git_get_project_description to be more generic
 - gitweb: Split git_project_list_body in two functions
 (this branch uses jn/ctags.)

Waiting for comments.

* jc/dotdot-is-parent-directory (2011-05-02) 1 commit
 - specifying ranges: we did not mean to make ".." an empty set

Updated documentation.

* mg/diff-stat-count (2011-05-03) 2 commits
 - diff-options.txt: describe --stat-{width,name-width,count}
 - diff: introduce --stat-count to limit the stat lines

There was a miscounting spotted.  Need another round.

* jc/require-work-tree-exists (2011-05-04) 1 commit
 - require-work-tree wants more than what its name says

Make "git pull" run from a random place work as long as GIT_DIR and
GIT_WORK_TREE are set up correctly.  I am not absolutely sure if that
is a sane use case, though.

* jc/add-delete-default (2011-04-19) 1 commit
 - git add: notice removal of tracked paths by default
 (this branch uses jc/fix-add-u-unmerged.)

* jk/maint-merge-rename-create (2011-03-25) 3 commits
 - merge: turn on rewrite detection
 - merge: handle renames with replacement content
 - t3030: fix accidental success in symlink rename

Peff wanted to reroll this.

* rr/rerere-clear-libify (2011-04-13) 1 commit
 - rerere: Expose an API corresponding to 'clear' functionality

Jonathan had good comments on moving the garbage collection interface as
well. Perhaps needs a re-roll.

* jc/index-pack (2011-02-25) 5 commits
 - index-pack --verify: read anomalous offsets from v2 idx file
 - write_idx_file: need_large_offset() helper function
 - index-pack: --verify
 - write_idx_file: introduce a struct to hold idx customization options
 - index-pack: group the delta-base array entries also by type

Still a WIP. Need to put histogram output into index-pack --verify to
really kill verify-pack.

* jk/tag-contains (2010-07-05) 4 commits
 - Why is "git tag --contains" so slow?
 - default core.clockskew variable to one day
 - limit "contains" traversals based on commit timestamp
 - tag: speed up --contains calculation

The idea of the bottom one is probably Ok, except that the use of object
flags needs to be rethought, or at least the helper needs to be moved to
builtin/tag.c to make it clear that it should not be used outside the
current usage context.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* mk/grep-pcre (2011-05-05) 3 commits
 - grep: Put calls to fixmatch() and regmatch() into patmatch()
 - contrib/completion: --line-number to git grep
 - Documentation: Add --line-number to git-grep synopsis

This is without the real PCRE integration.  The above three looked
reasonable clean-ups regardless.

Will merge to "next".

* vh/config-interactive-singlekey-doc (2011-05-05) 5 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-06 at 46b522c)
 + git-reset.txt: better docs for '--patch'
 + git-checkout.txt: better docs for '--patch'
 + git-stash.txt: better docs for '--patch'
 + git-add.txt: document 'interactive.singlekey'
 + config.txt: 'interactive.singlekey; is used by...

* jc/maint-branch-mergeoptions (2011-05-04) 1 commit
 - merge: fix branch.<name>.mergeoptions
 (this branch is used by mg/merge-ff-config.)

Fix branch.<name>.mergeoptions that does not override merge.<option>; this
is needed for the "merge.ff" configuration topic to correctly work.

* jn/ctags (2011-04-29) 3 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-06 at 5c574ff)
 + gitweb: Mark matched 'ctag' / contents tag (?by_tag=foo)
 + gitweb: Change the way "content tags" ('ctags') are handled
 + gitweb: Restructure projects list generation
 (this branch is used by jn/ctags-more.)

  (merged to 'next' on 2011-05-02 at e57b66f)
 + "add -p": work-around an old laziness that does not coalesce hunks
 + add--interactive.perl: factor out repeated --recount option
 + t3701: Editing a split hunk in an "add -p" session
 + add -p: 'q' should really quit

Probably needs tests.

* ld/p4-preserve-user-names (2011-04-21) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-04-29 at 25116c8)
 + git-p4: add option to preserve user names

Luke wants to update this, so will not be merging to "master" until the
update settles down.

* jh/dirstat-lines (2011-04-29) 8 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2011-04-29 at a302674)

 (this branch is used by js/maint-send-pack-stateless-rpc-deadlock-fix.)

Will merge to "master" by the end of week #3.
