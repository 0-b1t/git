What's cooking in git.git (Feb 2010, #02; Sun, 07)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

There shouldn't be anything exciting to see here right now.  Please test
"master" branch to avoid giving regressions to end users; we are at
1.7.0-rc2 and I am hoping that we can release the 1.7.0 on the 10th.

--------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* sp/maint-push-sideband (2010-02-05) 6 commits
 - receive-pack: Send hook output over side band #2
 - receive-pack: Wrap status reports inside side-band-64k
 - receive-pack: Refactor how capabilities are shown to the client
 - send-pack: demultiplex a sideband stream with status data
 - run-command: support custom fd-set in async
 - run-command: Allow stderr to be a caller supplied pipe
 (this branch is used by sp/push-sideband.)

Based on 1.6.5 maintenance track

* sp/push-sideband (2010-02-05) 0 commits
 (this branch uses sp/maint-push-sideband.)

And my conflict resolution in #ifdef WINDOWS codepath (meaning: untested,
please check).

* ac/cvsimport-revision-mapping (2010-02-06) 1 commit
 - cvsimport: new -R option: generate .git/cvs-revisions mapping

* jc/maint-1.6.3-imap-send-bool-config-fix (2010-02-06) 1 commit
 - imap-send: fix longstanding configuration parser bug

* js/rebase-origin-x (2010-02-05) 1 commit
 - [RFC w/o test and incomplete] rebase: add -x option to record original commit name

* rs/git-dir-cleanup (2010-02-06) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-06 at ef8ab9b)
 + Resurrect "git grep --no-index"
 + setenv(GIT_DIR) clean-up

* jc/typo (2010-02-03) 1 commit
 - Typofixes outside documentation area

* jk/grep-double-dash (2010-02-06) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-02-07 at 2ac040d)
 + accept "git grep -- pattern"

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* jn/maint-makedepend (2010-01-26) 5 commits
 - Makefile: drop dependency on $(wildcard */*.h)
 - Makefile: clean up http-walker.o dependency rules
 - Makefile: remove wt-status.h from LIB_H
 - Makefile: make sure test helpers are rebuilt when headers change
 - Makefile: add missing header file dependencies
 (this branch is used by jn/makedepend and jn/master-makedepend.)

These look sensible clean-up that could go to maint later.

* jn/master-makedepend (2010-01-26) 0 commits
 (this branch uses jn/maint-makedepend; is used by jn/makedepend.)

This is to help merging the clean-up to "master".

* jn/makedepend (2010-01-31) 9 commits
 - Makefile: always remove .depend directories on 'make clean'
 - Makefile: tuck away generated makefile fragments in .depend
 - Teach Makefile to check header dependencies
 - Makefile: list standalone program object files in PROGRAM_OBJS
 - Makefile: lazily compute header dependencies
 - Makefile: list generated object files in OBJECTS
 - Makefile: disable default implicit rules
 - Makefile: rearrange dependency rules
 - Makefile: transport.o depends on branch.h now
 (this branch uses jn/maint-makedepend and jn/master-makedepend.)

And this is to build on top.  I don't want to touch build infrastructure
during the pre-release freeze too much to avoid the last minute hassles
that is only discovered when I try to cut RPMs; hence this will stay out
of 'master' until 1.7.0 ships.
