What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2010, #10; Sun, 31)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed with '-' are
only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are in 'next'.  The ones
marked with '.' do not appear in any of the integration branches, but I am
still holding onto them.

We are passed 1.7.0-rc1; please test "master" branch to avoid giving
regressions to end users.  Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to "master"]

* jl/diff-submodule-ignore (2010-01-24) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-01-25 at fbe713d)
 + Teach diff --submodule that modified submodule directory is dirty
 + git diff: Don't test submodule dirtiness with --ignore-submodules
 (this branch uses jc/ce-uptodate.)

* jc/ce-uptodate (2010-01-24) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-01-25 at fbe713d)
 + Make ce_uptodate() trustworthy again
 (this branch is used by jl/diff-submodule-ignore.)

* gp/maint-cvsserver (2010-01-26) 1 commit
 + git-cvsserver: allow regex metacharacters in CVSROOT

* fk/threaded-grep (2010-01-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-01-26 at 687b2a6)
 + Threaded grep
 (this branch uses jc/grep-q.)

400% performance gain on a 4-core box ;-)

* jc/grep-q (2010-01-25) 1 commit
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-01-26 at 687b2a6)
 + grep: expose "status-only" feature via -q
 (this branch is used by fk/threaded-grep.)

[New Topics]

* jn/maint-makedepend (2010-01-26) 5 commits
 - Makefile: drop dependency on $(wildcard */*.h)
 - Makefile: clean up http-walker.o dependency rules
 - Makefile: remove wt-status.h from LIB_H
 - Makefile: make sure test helpers are rebuilt when headers change
 - Makefile: add missing header file dependencies
 (this branch is used by jn/makedepend and jn/master-makedepend.)

These look sensible clean-up that could go to maint.

* jn/master-makedepend (2010-01-26) 0 commits
 (this branch uses jn/maint-makedepend; is used by jn/makedepend.)

This is to help merging the clean-up to "master".

* jn/makedepend (2010-01-31) 9 commits
 - Makefile: always remove .depend directories on 'make clean'
 - Makefile: tuck away generated makefile fragments in .depend
 - Teach Makefile to check header dependencies
 - Makefile: list standalone program object files in PROGRAM_OBJS
 - Makefile: lazily compute header dependencies
 - Makefile: list generated object files in OBJECTS
 - Makefile: disable default implicit rules
 - Makefile: rearrange dependency rules
 - Makefile: transport.o depends on branch.h now
 (this branch uses jn/maint-makedepend and jn/master-makedepend.)

And this is to build on top.

* ms/filter-branch-submodule (2010-01-28) 2 commits
  (merged to 'next' on 2010-01-28 at 226cbf8)
 + filter-branch: Add tests for submodules in tree-filter
 + filter-branch: Fix to allow replacing submodules with another content

* jc/checkout-detached (2010-01-29) 1 commit
 - Reword "detached HEAD" notification

* jc/maint-fix-test-perm (2010-01-30) 2 commits
 - lib-patch-mode.sh: Fix permission
 - t6000lib: Fix permission

* jh/gitweb-caching (2010-01-30) 8 commits
 - gitweb: Add an option to force version match
 - gitweb: Add optional extra parameter to die_error, for extended explanation
 - gitweb: add a "string" variant of print_sort_th
 - gitweb: add a "string" variant of print_local_time
 - gitweb: Check that $site_header etc. are defined before using them
 - gitweb: Makefile improvements
 - gitweb: Load checking
 - gitweb: Make running t9501 test with '--debug' reliable and usable

* jn/makefile-script-lib (2010-01-31) 1 commit
 - Do not install shell libraries executable

* mv/request-pull-modernize (2010-01-29) 1 commit
 - request-pull: avoid mentioning that the start point is a single commit

* sp/maint-fast-import-large-blob (2010-01-29) 1 commit
 - fast-import: Stream very large blobs directly to pack
 (this branch is used by sp/fast-import-large-blob.)

Importing a large blob via fast-import may bust the pack size limit (or
2GB filesize limit found on some filesystems).

* sp/fast-import-large-blob (2010-01-29) 0 commits
 (this branch uses sp/maint-fast-import-large-blob.)

And this is to help merging the topic to newer codebase.

--------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* cc/reset-keep (2010-01-19) 5 commits
 - reset: disallow using --keep when there are unmerged entries
 - reset: disallow "reset --keep" outside a work tree
 - Documentation: reset: describe new "--keep" option
 - reset: add test cases for "--keep" option
 - reset: add option "--keep" to "git reset"

I do not think I'd ever use this, and I am not convinced I can sell this
to users as a great new feature without confusing them unnecessarily, but
perhaps queuing it to pu to give it wider visibility may help somebody
coming up with a better way to defend the feature and introduce it to
users without confusing them than Christan nor I managed to.

* jh/notes (2010-01-27) 23 commits
 - builtin-notes: Add "add" subcommand for appending to note objects

 - Documentation: Generalize git-notes docs to 'objects' instead of 'commits'
 - builtin-notes: Add "prune" subcommand for removing notes for missing objects

 - Teach builtin-notes to remove empty notes
 - Teach notes code to properly preserve non-notes in the notes tree

 - Refactor notes concatenation into a flexible interface for combining notes
 - Notes API: Allow multiple concurrent notes trees with new struct notes_tree
 - Notes API: write_notes_tree(): Store the notes tree in the database
 - Notes API: for_each_note(): Traverse the entire notes tree with a callback
 - Notes API: get_note(): Return the note annotating the given object
 - Notes API: remove_note(): Remove note objects from the notes tree structure
 - Notes API: add_note(): Add note objects to the internal notes tree structure
 - Notes API: init_notes(): Initialize the notes tree from the given notes ref
 - Add tests for checking correct handling of $GIT_NOTES_REF and core.notesRef
 - Notes API: get_commit_notes() -> format_note() + remove the commit restriction
 - Cosmetic fixes to notes.c

* jc/grep-author-all-match-implicit (2010-01-17) 1 commit
