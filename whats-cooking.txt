What's cooking in git.git (Jan 2009, #02; Sun, 11)
--------------------------------------------------

Here are the topics that have been cooking.  Commits prefixed
with '-' are only in 'pu' while commits prefixed with '+' are
in 'next'.  The ones marked with '.' do not appear in any of the branches,
but I am still holding onto them.

The topics list the commits in reverse chronological order.  The topics
meant to be merged to the maintenance series have "maint-" in their names.

Sorry to have been lagging a bit.  There are a few patches I am interested
in but haven't studied yet nor mentioned here.  I've been swamped outside
git lately for the past few days, but hopefully I can get to them shortly.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[New Topics]

* rs/fgrep (Sat Jan 10 00:18:34 2009 +0100) 2 commits
 + grep: don't call regexec() for fixed strings
 + grep -w: forward to next possible position after rejected match

* lt/zlib-wrap-xprm (Wed Jan 7 19:54:47 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 - Wrap inflateInit to retry allocation after releasing pack memory

Need to clean up the log message, perhaps rebase it to maint-1.6.0 and
start cooking in 'next'.

* jc/maint-format-patch (Sat Jan 10 12:41:33 2009 -0800) 1 commit
 + format-patch: show patch text for the root commit

* tr/maint-no-index-fixes (Wed Jan 7 12:15:30 2009 +0100) 3 commits
 + diff --no-index -q: fix endless loop
 + diff --no-index: test for pager after option parsing
 + diff: accept -- when using --no-index

* gb/gitweb-opml (Fri Jan 2 13:49:30 2009 +0100) 2 commits
 - gitweb: suggest name for OPML view
 - gitweb: don't use pathinfo for global actions

* mh/maint-commit-color-status (Thu Jan 8 19:53:05 2009 +0100) 2 commits
 - git-status -v: color diff output when color.ui is set
 - git-commit: color status output when color.ui is set

* ks/maint-mailinfo-folded (Thu Jan 8 01:43:42 2009 +0300) 1 commit
 - mailinfo: correctly handle multiline 'Subject:' header

* js/patience-diff (Thu Jan 1 17:39:37 2009 +0100) 3 commits
 - bash completions: Add the --patience option
 - Introduce the diff option '--patience'
 - Implement the patience diff algorithm

All of the above 'pu' topics are ready for 'next'.

* ap/clone-into-empty (Fri Jan 9 02:24:23 2009 +0300) 2 commits
 - Use is_pseudo_dir_name everywhere
 - Allow cloning to an existing empty directory

There is an updated patch that only refactors the repeated code to check
if a dirent is dot or dot-dot posted, which I should have picked up to
replace these but I haven't yet (the "clone into empty" can and should
build on top of it).

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled and may need help and prodding to go forward]

* ds/uintmax-config (Mon Nov 3 09:14:28 2008 -0900) 1 commit
 - autoconf: Enable threaded delta search when pthreads are supported

This automatically enables threaded delta search code when autoconf
detects pthreads are usable.  I haven't heard neither positive nor
negative comments from minority platforms that might be harmed, but
this feels like the right thing to do, so perhaps the best course of
action is to merge this down to 'master' and see if anybody screams.

* jc/blame (Wed Jun 4 22:58:40 2008 -0700) 2 commits
 + blame: show "previous" information in --porcelain/--incremental
   format
 + git-blame: refactor code to emit "porcelain format" output

This gives Porcelains (like gitweb) the information on the commit _before_
the one that the final blame is laid on, which should save them one
rev-parse to dig further.  The line number in the "previous" information
may need refining, and sanity checking code for reference counting may
need to be resurrected before this can move forward.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[Actively cooking]

* rs/maint-shortlog-foldline (Tue Jan 6 21:41:06 2009 +0100) 1 commit

   al. do

* tr/rebase-root (Fri Jan 2 23:28:29 2009 +0100) 4 commits

I should be able to find time to read this over again and merge to
'next' sometime this week.

This would be the right thing to do for command line use,
but gitk will be hit due to tcl/tk's limitation, so I am holding
this back for now.
