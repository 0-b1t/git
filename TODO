[jc: a very nice write-up of a subprojects workflow. I do not
 remember if it produced any actionable items, though]

"git ref-log" command to interact with ref-log?

git-split

[jc: no response to the initial review comments]

From: Sean <seanlkml@sympatico.ca>
Subject: [RFC PATCH] Add WEBDAV timeout to http-fetch.
Message-ID: <BAYC1-PASMTP11CF83A008B0B3BA5F6B15AE100@CEZ.ICE>

Use CURLOPT_TIMEOUT to recover from stuck read() early.

[jc: the trouble that triggered this patch was WEBDAV on the
 server side not responding and the proposed commit log says so,
 but it seems that the patch is applicable and useful for other
 requests.  I suspect ls_remote() call should be removed from
 fetch_indices(). ] 

From: Luben Tuikov <ltuikov@yahoo.com>
Subject: [PATCH] gitweb: Convert Content-Disposition filenames into qtext
Message-ID: <20061006191801.68649.qmail@web31815.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Use qtext quoting for Content-Disposition.

[jc: the purpose of the patch was murky -- we wanted to avoid
 breaking the parsing of filename="value" by underquoting, but
 I think it is also prudent not to throw locally unsafe characters
 in the suggested filename to be used, so replacement regexp
 would need to be updated from the one proposed in the original
 patch.]


From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org>
Subject: Re: git show and gitweb gives different result for kernel
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0610061202060.3952@g5.osdl.org>

Maybe allow gitweb to show diff with any parent and diff --cc,
not just diff with the first parent for a merge.

Technical (milder)
------------------

* pack-refs --all and make it not pack active branches.

* redo git-annotate as synonym to "git-blame -c".

* duplicated refspec given to "fetch-pack a a a" makes it emit
  strange error message because it triggers the "match only
  once" logic.  Maybe strip the dups on the input side
  (Uwe Zeisberger
  <20060608073857.GA5072@informatik.uni-freiburg.de>). 

* map only parts of huge packfiles and LRU fragments of them.
  People are starting to try git on projects with deep history
  and/or many objects, e.g. Mozilla.

* upload-pack support for start fetching from any valid point on
  the history, not just published refs. (Erik W. Biederman
  <m164jc9ekx.fsf@ebiederm.dsl.xmission.com>)

* daemon --strict-symlink.

* Maybe grok PGP signed text/plain in applymbox as well.

Technical (trivial)
-------------------

* Mbx (not mbox) support for git-mailsplit.

* log-tree.c: pad sequence numbers with leading 0 if a series is
  larger than 9, around ll.133?

* git-clone fail .git/refs/foo (Yann Dirson <ydirson@altern.org>)
  <20060610225040.GA7766@nowhere.earth>

* git-proxy should be spawned with sh -c 'command' $1 $2.

* Maybe a true git-proxy command that reads the first request
  pkt-line, and redirects the request to its real destination.

* test scripts for the relative directory path stuff.
