It might make sense to make --use-separate-remote the default.

[jc: The only downside that I can think of is that it affects me
or anybody who works on more than one machine on multiple
branches slightly negatively.

But that is just a minor inconvenience to a minority.  Most of
the world follow others' repositories, and defaulting to use
separate-remotes would help them a lot.]

commit walkers still have issues with packed and then pruned
refs.

Repeated requests against git-daemon makes it stuck under --syslog

[jc: does not reproduce easily for me; has anybody seen it?]

git-mirror (reverse of git-push --all).

[jc: may want the finished version for inclusion]

"git ref-log" command to interact with ref-log?

[jc: not much interest from users?]

AsciiDoc 8 does not grok documents written for AsciiDoc 7 out of
the box.

[jc: limbo?]

Maybe allow gitweb to show diff with any parent and diff --cc,
not just diff with the first parent for a merge.

[jc: Jakub is interested in it]

Technical (milder)
------------------

* duplicated refspec given to "fetch-pack a a a" makes it emit
  strange error message because it triggers the "match only
  once" logic.  Maybe strip the dups on the input side
  (Uwe Zeisberger
  <20060608073857.GA5072@informatik.uni-freiburg.de>). 

* map only parts of huge packfiles and LRU fragments of them.
  People are starting to try git on projects with deep history
  and/or many objects, e.g. Mozilla.

  [jc: ping Shawn or give up and do this myself.]

* upload-pack support for start fetching from any valid point on
  the history, not just published refs. (Erik W. Biederman
  <m164jc9ekx.fsf@ebiederm.dsl.xmission.com>)

* daemon --strict-symlink.

* Maybe grok PGP signed text/plain in applymbox as well.

Technical (trivial)
-------------------

* Mbx (not mbox) support for git-mailsplit.

* log-tree.c: pad sequence numbers with leading 0 if a series is
  larger than 9, around ll.133?

* git-clone fail .git/refs/foo (Yann Dirson <ydirson@altern.org>)
  <20060610225040.GA7766@nowhere.earth>

* git-proxy should be spawned with sh -c 'command' $1 $2.

* Maybe a true git-proxy command that reads the first request
  pkt-line, and redirects the request to its real destination.

* test scripts for the relative directory path stuff.
