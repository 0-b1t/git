What to expect after 0.99.5
===========================

This is written in a form of to-do list for me, so if I say
"accept patch", it means I do not currently plan to do that
myself.  People interested in seeing it materialize please take
a hint.


Documentation
-------------

* Accept patches from people who actually have done CVS
  migration and update the cvs-migration documentation.
  Link the documentation from the main git.txt page.

* Link howto docs from the git.txt page. [DONE]

* Update the SubmittingPatches document to add MUA specific
  hints on how to disable unwanted MIME and flowed-text by
  collecting past list postings [DONE].  Accept patches from
  people who was hit by shiny blue bat to update the same.

* Talk about using rsync just once at the beginning when
  initializing a remote repository so that local packs do not
  need to be expanded.  I personally do not think we need tool
  support for this.

* Update tutorial to cover shared repository style a bit more,
  maybe with a toy project that involves two or three
  repositories.

* Update tutorial to cover setting up repository hooks to do
  common tasks. [IN PROGRESS]

* Get help to properly use asciidoc in tutorial.

* Maybe justify and demonstrate an Octopus in the tutorial.  Add
  it to the glossary.


Technical (heavier)
-------------------

* Tony Luck reported an unfortunate glitch in the 3-way merge.
  Encourage discussions to come up with a not-so-expensive way
  to catch the kind of ambiguities that led to his misery.
  [Underway.  Thanks Daniel and Fredrik for taking an
  initiative.]

* We might want to optimize cloning with GIT native transport
  not to explode the pack, and store it in objects/pack instead.
  We would need a tool to generate an idx file out of a pack
  file for this.  Also this itself may turn out to be a bad
  idea, making the set of packs in repositories everybody has
  different from each other.


Technical (milder)
------------------

* When the branch head pointed by $GIT_DIR/HEAD changes while
  the index file and working tree are looking the other way
  (e.g. somebody pushed into your repository, or you ran "git
  fetch" to update the ref your working tree is on), "git
  checkout" without -f gets confused.  Figure out a good way to
  handle this. [DONE]

  We still have the same issue with "git fetch".  Fetching into
  the branch one is on _may_ need to do the same thing as
  fetching into anonymous head and then do the resolve.  At
  least it needs a warning. [DONE]

* "git commit -m" should work for initial commits and perhaps
  merge commits as well.  Warning about merge is still a good
  thing to do, while -m is useful in scripted non-interactive
  use, so we need to be careful. [DONE - waiting for response]

* Encourage concrete proposals to commit log message templates
  we discussed some time ago.

* Bug Ryan and work with him to update send-email easier to use.
  [Resurrected it for Debian build.]

* Look at portability fixes from Jason Riedy

    http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~ejr/gits/git.git#portable 

  [Looked at it.  Maybe promising.  Maybe not.]

* Accept patches to cause "read-tree -u" delete a directory when
  it makes it empty.

* Perhaps accept patches to introduce the concept of "patch flow
  expressed as ref mappings" Josef has been advocating about.

* Perhaps accept patches to do undo/redo.

* MIMEified applymbox to grok B and Q encodings in headers and
  turn them into UTF-8; unwrap QP; explode multipart.

* "git cherry-pick" that applies the patch an existing commit
  introduces in its ancestry chain, possibly using the 3-way
  merge machinery. [Done.  Needs documentation.]

* Update rebase using the cherry-pick command. [Done]

* Redo "git revert" using 3-way merge machinery. [Done]

* A tool to detect, show and prune already merged topic
  branches.

* Set up an automated documentation rebuilding procedure at
  kernel.org, using update hook mechanism. [Almost, but not
  quite.]  Describe it in a howto form [Done].

* Enhance "git repack" to not always use --all; this would be
  handy if the repository contains wagging heads like "pu" in
  git.git repository.

* Internally split the project into non-doc and doc parts; add
  an extra root for the doc part and merge from it; move the
  internal doc source to a separate repository, like the +Meta
  repository; experiment if this results in a reasonable
  workflow, and document it in howto form if it does.

* Add names to all nodes in show-branch.

* Option to limit rename detection for more than N paths.


Technical (trivial)
-------------------

* Look at and merge Debian fixes from Tommi [Done].

* Perhaps "git branch -d" to delete a branch.

* Remove "git clone-dumb-http".

* We would want test scripts for the relative directory path
  stuff Linus has been working on.  So far, the following
  commands should be usable with relative directory paths:

    update-cache
    ls-files
    diff-files
    diff-cache
    diff-tree
    rev-list
