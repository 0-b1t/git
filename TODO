Recent issues
-------------

* Use blame machinery to track a single file (not path) in finer
  grained way.

From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>
Message-ID: <alpine.LFD.0.98.0704201554550.9964@woody.linux-foundation.org>

[jc: I have a fixed-up one parked in 'pu' and also outlined what
other things I think are needed in my response:

    Message-ID: <7vwt06wqv8.fsf@assigned-by-dhcp.cox.net>
]

* Use git.git as the first public guinea pig of subproject

From: Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net>
Message-ID: <7vmz13z4au.fsf@assigned-by-dhcp.cox.net>

Use git.git as the first public guinea pig of subproject stuff,
by dropping git-gui/ directory first and then binding git-gui.git 
as a subproject there.  This needs to wait at least until v1.5.2
ships and gets installed at kernel.org and repo.or.cz

* Decide what to do with 'filter' and 'ident' attribute patches.

From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>
Message-ID: <alpine.LFD.0.98.0704212243080.9964@woody.linux-foundation.org>

If we were to include it, we would need to make it clear that
this is a long piece of rope and you can strangle yourself with
it unless you are careful, and clarify what is and isn't
considered to be "careful".  I have parked updates in 'pu', but
I do not know they are clear enough.

* TODO list management

From: Daniel Barkalow <barkalow@iabervon.org>
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0704241312210.28708@iabervon.org>

Maybe abandon this and have something similar on the main
branch, starting full at the beginning of the cycle and ending
empty (or full of "not in next release" entries) at the release?

* git-daemon bug?

From: Franck Bui-Huu <vagabon.xyz@gmail.com>
Message-ID: <450EABD0.1040102@innova-card.com>

Repeated requests against git-daemon makes it stuck under --syslog

[jc: does not reproduce easily for me; has anybody seen it?]

* git-mirror (reverse of git-push --all).

From: Shawn Pearce <spearce@spearce.org>
Message-ID: <20060926215745.GC8177@spearce.org>

[jc: may want the finished version for inclusion]

* AsciiDoc 8 would break our documentation.

From: Stefan Richter <stefanr@s5r6.in-berlin.de>
Message-ID: <4523EC14.6070806@s5r6.in-berlin.de>

AsciiDoc 8 does not grok documents written for AsciiDoc 7 out of
the box.

[jc: limbo?]

* Gitweb diff on merge commits

From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org>
Subject: Re: git show and gitweb gives different result for kernel
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0610061202060.3952@g5.osdl.org>

Maybe allow gitweb to show diff with any parent and diff --cc,
not just diff with the first parent for a merge.

[jc: Jakub is interested in it]

Technical (milder)
------------------

* upload-pack support for start fetching from any valid point on
  the history, not just published refs. (Erik W. Biederman
  <m164jc9ekx.fsf@ebiederm.dsl.xmission.com>)

* daemon --strict-symlink.

* Maybe grok PGP signed text/plain in applymbox as well.

Technical (trivial)
-------------------

* Mbx (not mbox) support for git-mailsplit.

* git-clone fail .git/refs/foo (Yann Dirson <ydirson@altern.org>)
  <20060610225040.GA7766@nowhere.earth>

* git-proxy should be spawned with sh -c 'command' $1 $2.

[jc: should it?]

* Maybe a true git-proxy command that reads the first request
  pkt-line, and redirects the request to its real destination.

* test scripts for the relative directory path stuff.
