[jc: no response to the initial review comments]


Technical (milder)
------------------

* duplicated refspec given to "fetch-pack a a a" makes it emit
  strange error message because it triggers the "match only
  once" logic.  Maybe strip the dups on the input side
  (Uwe Zeisberger
  <20060608073857.GA5072@informatik.uni-freiburg.de>). 

* map only parts of huge packfiles and LRU fragments of them.
  People are starting to try git on projects with deep history
  and/or many objects, e.g. Mozilla.

* upload-pack support for start fetching from any valid point on
  the history, not just published refs. (Erik W. Biederman
  <m164jc9ekx.fsf@ebiederm.dsl.xmission.com>)

* daemon --strict-symlink.

* Maybe grok PGP signed text/plain in applymbox as well.

Technical (trivial)
-------------------

* Mbx (not mbox) support for git-mailsplit.

* log-tree.c: pad sequence numbers with leading 0 if a series is
  larger than 9, around ll.133?

* git-clone fail .git/refs/foo (Yann Dirson <ydirson@altern.org>)
  <20060610225040.GA7766@nowhere.earth>

* git-proxy should be spawned with sh -c 'command' $1 $2.

* Maybe a true git-proxy command that reads the first request
  pkt-line, and redirects the request to its real destination.

* test scripts for the relative directory path stuff.
