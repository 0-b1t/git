Maybe abandon this and have something similar on the main
branch, starting full at the beginning of the cycle and ending
empty (or full of "not in next release" entries) at the release?

Repeated requests against git-daemon makes it stuck under --syslog

[jc: does not reproduce easily for me; has anybody seen it?]

Message-ID: <20060926215745.GC8177@spearce.org>

git-mirror (reverse of git-push --all).

[jc: may want the finished version for inclusion]

AsciiDoc 8 does not grok documents written for AsciiDoc 7 out of
the box.

[jc: limbo?]

From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org>
Subject: Re: git show and gitweb gives different result for kernel
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0610061202060.3952@g5.osdl.org>

Maybe allow gitweb to show diff with any parent and diff --cc,
not just diff with the first parent for a merge.

[jc: Jakub is interested in it]

Technical (milder)
------------------

* upload-pack support for start fetching from any valid point on
  the history, not just published refs. (Erik W. Biederman
  <m164jc9ekx.fsf@ebiederm.dsl.xmission.com>)

* daemon --strict-symlink.

* Maybe grok PGP signed text/plain in applymbox as well.

Technical (trivial)
-------------------

* Mbx (not mbox) support for git-mailsplit.

* git-clone fail .git/refs/foo (Yann Dirson <ydirson@altern.org>)
  <20060610225040.GA7766@nowhere.earth>

* git-proxy should be spawned with sh -c 'command' $1 $2.

[jc: should it?]

* Maybe a true git-proxy command that reads the first request
  pkt-line, and redirects the request to its real destination.

* test scripts for the relative directory path stuff.
